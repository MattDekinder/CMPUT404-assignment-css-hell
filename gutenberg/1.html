<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>A Translator who has never felt his self-imposed
task to be a light one may be excused from
entering into explanations that would but too naturally
take the form of apologies. I will only say that
while I have striven to be as faithful as I could to
the words as well as to the sense of my author, the
following translation is not offered as being always
closely literal. The kind of verse employed I believe
to be that best fitted to give some idea, however
faint, of the rigidly measured and yet easy strength
of Dante’s <i>terza rima</i>; but whoever chooses to adopt
it with its constantly recurring demand for rhymes
necessarily becomes in some degree its servant. Such
students as wish to follow the poet word by word will
always find what they need in Dr. J. A. Carlyle’s
excellent prose version of the <i>Inferno</i>, a work to which
I have to acknowledge my own indebtedness at many
points.</p>

<p>The matter of the notes, it is needless to say, has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>been in very great part found ready to my hand in
existing Commentaries. My edition of John Villani is
that of Florence, 1823.</p>

<p>The Note at page cx was printed before it had
been resolved to provide the volume with a copy of
Giotto’s portrait of Dante. I have to thank the
Council of the Arundel Society for their kind permission
to Messrs. Dawson to make use of their
lithograph of Mr. Seymour Kirkup’s invaluable sketch
in the production of the Frontispiece—a privilege that
would have been taken more advantage of had it not
been deemed advisable to work chiefly from the photograph
of the same sketch, given in the third volume
of the late Lord Vernon’s sumptuous and rare edition of
the <i>Inferno</i> (Florence, 1865). In this Vernon photograph,
as well as in the Arundel Society’s chromolithograph,
the disfiguring mark on the face caused
by the damage to the plaster of the fresco is faithfully
reproduced. A less degree of fidelity has been observed
in the Frontispiece; although the restoration has not
been carried the length of replacing the lost eye.</p>

<h2><a name="FLORENCE_AND_DANTE" id="FLORENCE_AND_DANTE"></a>FLORENCE AND DANTE.</h2>


<p>Dante is himself the hero of the <i>Divine Comedy</i>,
and ere many stages of the <i>Inferno</i> have been
passed the reader feels that all his steps are being
taken in a familiar companionship. When every allowance
has been made for what the exigencies of art
required him to heighten or suppress, it is still impossible
not to be convinced that the author is revealing
himself much as he really was—in some of his weakness
as well as in all his strength. The poem itself, by many
an unconscious touch, does for his moral portraiture
what the pencil of Giotto has done for the features of his
face. The one likeness answers marvellously to the
other; and, together, they have helped the world to
recognise in him the great example of a man of genius
who, though at first sight he may seem to be austere, is
soon found to attract our love by the depth of his feelings
as much as he wins our admiration by the wealth of
his fancy, and by the clearness of his judgment on everything
concerned with the lives and destiny of men. His
other writings in greater or less degree confirm the impression
of Dante’s character to be obtained from the
<i>Comedy</i>. Some of them are partly autobiographical;
and, studying as a whole all that is left to us of him, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
can gain a general notion of the nature of his career—when
he was born and what was his condition in life;
his early loves and friendships; his studies, military
service, and political aims; his hopes and illusions, and
the weary purgatory of his exile.</p>

<p>To the knowledge of Dante’s life and character
which is thus to be acquired, the formal biographies of
him have but little to add that is both trustworthy and
of value. Something of course there is in the traditional
story of his life that has come down from his time
with the seal of genuineness; and something that has
been ascertained by careful research among Florentine
and other documents. But when all that old and
modern <i>Lives</i> have to tell us has been sifted, the additional
facts regarding him are found to be but few; such
at least as are beyond dispute. Boccaccio, his earliest
biographer, swells out his <i>Life</i>, as the earlier commentators
on the <i>Comedy</i> do their notes, with what are
plainly but legendary amplifications of hints supplied
by Dante’s own words; while more recent and critical
writers succeed with infinite pains in little beyond
establishing, each to his own satisfaction, what was the
order of publication of the poet’s works, where he may
have travelled to, and when and for how long a time
he may have had this or that great lord for a patron.</p>

<p>A very few pages would therefore be enough to tell the
events of Dante’s life as far as they are certainly known.
But, to be of use as an introduction to the study of his
great poem, any biographical sketch must contain some
account—more or less full—of Florentine affairs before
and during his lifetime; for among the actors in these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
are to be found many of the persons of the <i>Comedy</i>.
In reading the poem we are never suffered for long
to forget his exile. From one point of view it is an
appeal to future ages from Florentine injustice and
ingratitude; from another, it is a long and passionate
plea with his native town to shake her in her stubborn
cruelty. In spite of the worst she can do against him
he remains no less her son. In the early copies of it,
the <i>Comedy</i> is well described as the work of Dante
Alighieri, the Florentine; since not only does he people
the other world by preference with Florentines, but it
is to Florence that, even when his words are bitter
against her, his heart is always feeling back. Among
the glories of Paradise he loves to let his memory rest
on the church in which he was baptized and the streets
he used to tread. He takes pleasure in her stones;
and with her towers and palaces Florence stands for
the unchanging background to the changing scenes of
his mystical pilgrimage.</p>

<p>The history of Florence during the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries agrees in general outline with that
of most of its neighbours. At the beginning of the
period it was a place of but little importance, ranking
far below Pisa both in wealth and political influence.
Though retaining the names and forms of municipal
government, inherited from early times, it was in reality
possessed of no effective control over its own affairs, and
was subject to its feudal superior almost as completely
as was ever any German village planted in the shadow of
a castle. To Florence, as to many a city of Northern
and Central Italy, the first opportunity of winning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
freedom came with the contest between Emperor and
Pope in the time of Hildebrand. In this quarrel the
Church found its best ally in Matilda, Countess of
Tuscany. She, to secure the goodwill of her subjects as
against the Emperor, yielded first one and then another
of her rights in Florence, generally by way of a pious
gift—an endowment for a religious house or an increase
of jurisdiction to the bishop—these concessions, however
veiled, being in effect so many additions to the
resources and liberties of the townsmen. She made
Rome her heir, and then Florence was able to play off
the Papal against the Imperial claims, yielding a kind
of barren homage to both Emperor and Pope, and only
studious to complete a virtual independence of both.
Florence had been Matilda’s favourite place of residence;
and, benefiting largely as it did by her easy
rule, it is no wonder that her name should have been
cherished by the Florentines for ages after as a household
word.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Nor is the greatest Florentine unmindful
of her. Foe of the Empire though she was, he only
remembers her piety; and it is by Matilda, as representing
the active religious life, that Dante is ushered
into the presence of Beatrice in the Earthly Paradise.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span></p><p>It was a true instinct which led Florence and other
cities to side rather with the Pope than with the Emperor
in the long-continued struggle between them for predominance
in Italy. With the Pope for overlord they
would at least have a master who was an Italian, and one
who, his title being imperfect, would in his own interest
be led to treat them with indulgence; while, in the permanent
triumph of the Emperor, Italy must have
become subject and tributary to Germany, and would
have seen new estates carved out of her fertile soil for
members of the German garrison. The danger was
brought home to many of the youthful commonwealths
during the eventful reign of Frederick Barbarossa
(1152-1190). Strong in Germany beyond most of his
predecessors, that monarch ascended the throne with
high prerogative views, in which he was confirmed by
the slavish doctrine of some of the new civilians. According
to these there could be only one master in the
world; as far as regarded the things of time, but one
source of authority in Christendom. They maintained
everything to be the Emperor’s that he chose to take.
When he descended into Italy to enforce his claims, the
cities of the Lombard League met him in open battle.
Those of Tuscany, and especially Florence, bent before
the blast, temporising as long as they were able, and
making the best terms they could when the choice lay
between submission and open revolt. Even Florence,
it is true, strong in her allies, did once take arms
against an Imperial lieutenant; but as a rule she never
refused obedience in words, and never yielded it in
fact beyond what could not be helped. In her pursuit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
of advantages, skilfully using every opportunity, and
steadfast of aim even when most she appeared to
waver, she displayed something of the same address
that was long to be noted as a trait in the character
of the individual Florentine.</p>

<p>The storm was weathered, although not wholly without
loss. When, towards the close of his life, and after he
had broken his strength against the obstinate patriotism
of Lombardy, Frederick visited Florence in 1185, it was
as a master justly displeased with servants who, while
they had not openly rebelled against him, had yet proved
eminently unprofitable, and whom he was concerned to
punish if not to destroy. On the complaint of the
neighbouring nobles, that they were oppressed and had
been plundered by the city, he gave orders for the
restoration to them of their lands and castles. This
accomplished, all the territory left to Florence was a
narrow belt around the walls. Villani even says that
for the four years during which Frederick still lived the
Commonwealth was wholly landless. And here, rather
than lose ourselves among the endless treaties, leagues,
and campaigns which fill so many pages of the chronicles,
it may be worth while shortly to glance at the constitution
of Florentine society, and especially at the place held in
it by the class which found its protector in Barbarossa.</p>

<p>Much about the time at which the Commonwealth was
relieved of its feudal trammels, as a result of the favour
or the necessities of Matilda, it was beginning to extend
its commerce and increase its industry. Starting somewhat
late on the career on which Venice, Genoa, and
Pisa were already far advanced, Florence was as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
strenuous to make up for lost time, and soon displayed
a rare comprehension of the nature of the enterprise.
It may be questioned if ever, until quite modern times,
there has been anywhere so clear an understanding of
the truth that public wellbeing is the sum of private
prosperity, or such an enlightened perception of what
tends to economical progress. Florence had no special
command of raw material for her manufactures, no sea-port
of her own, and no monopoly unless in the natural
genius of her people. She could therefore thrive only
by dint of holding open her communications with the
world at large, and grudged no pains either of war or
diplomacy to keep at Pisa a free way out and in for
her merchandise. Already in the twelfth century she
received through that port the rough woollens of
Flanders, which, after being skilfully dressed and dyed,
were sent out at great profit to every market of Europe.
At a somewhat later period the Florentines were to give
as strong a proof of their financial capacity as this was
of their industrial. It was they who first conducted a
large business in bills of exchange, and who first struck
a gold coin which, being kept of invariable purity,
passed current in every land where men bought and
sold—even in countries where the very name of
Florence was unknown.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>In a community thus devoted to industry and commerce,
it was natural that a great place should be filled
by merchants. These were divided into six guilds, the
members of which, with the notaries and lawyers, who
composed a seventh, formed the true body of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
citizens. Originally the consuls of these guilds were
the only elected officials in the city, and in the early
days of its liberty they were even charged with political
duties, and are found, for example, signing a treaty of
peace with a neighbouring state. In the fully developed
commune it was only the wealthier citizens—the members,
we may assume, of these guilds—who, along with
the nobles,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> were eligible for and had the right of electing
to the public offices. Below them was the great body
of the people; all, that is, of servile condition or engaged
in the meaner kinds of business. From one point of
view, the liberties of the citizens were only their privileges.
But although the labourers and humbler tradesmen
were without franchises, their interests were not therefore
neglected, being bound up with those of the one or
two thousand citizens who shared with the patricians
the control of public affairs.</p>

<p>There were two classes of nobles with whom Florence
had to reckon as she awoke to life—those within the
walls, and those settled in the neighbouring country.
In later times it was a favourite boast among the noble
citizens—a boast indulged in by Dante—that they were
descended from ancient Roman settlers on the banks
of the Arno. A safer boast would in many cases have
been that their ancestors had come to Italy in the train
of Otho and other conquering Emperors. Though
settled in the city, in some cases for generations, the
patrician families were not altogether of it, being
distinguished from the other citizens, if not always by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>
the possession of ancestral landward estates, at least by
their delight in war and contempt for honest industry.
But with the faults of a noble class they had many of
its good qualities. Of these the Republic suffered them
to make full proof, allowing them to lead in war and
hold civil offices out of all proportion to their numbers.</p>

<p>Like the city itself, the nobles in the country around
had been feudally subject to the Marquis of Tuscany.
After Matilda’s death they claimed to hold direct from
the Empire; which meant in practice to be above all
law. They exercised absolute jurisdiction over their
serfs and dependants, and, when favoured by the situation
of their castles, took toll, like the robber barons of
Germany, of the goods which passed beneath their walls.
Already they had proved to be thorns in the side of the
industrious burghers; but at the beginning of the
twelfth century their neighbourhood became intolerable,
and for a couple of generations the chief political
work of Florence was to bring them to reason. Those
whose lands came up almost to the city gates were first
dealt with, and then in a widening circle the country
was cleared of the pest. Year after year, when the days
were lengthening out in spring, the roughly organised
city militia was mustered, war was declared against
some specially obnoxious noble and his fortress was
taken by surprise, or, failing that, was subjected to a
siege. In the absence of a more definite grievance, it
was enough to declare his castle dangerously near the
city. These expeditions were led by the nobles who
were already citizens, while the country neighbours of
the victim looked on with indifference, or even helped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>
to waste the lands or force the stronghold of a rival.
The castle once taken, it was either levelled with the
ground, or was restored to the owner on condition of
his yielding service to the Republic. And, both by way
of securing a hold upon an unwilling vassal and of
adding a wealthy house and some strong arms to the
Commonwealth, he was compelled, along with his family,
to reside in Florence for a great part of every year.</p>

<p>With a wider territory and an increasing commerce,
it was natural for Florence to assume more and more
the attitude of a sovereign state, ready, when need was,
to impose its will upon its neighbours, or to join with
them for the common defence of Tuscany. In the
noble class and its retainers, recruited as has been
described, it was possessed of a standing army which,
whether from love of adventure or greed of plunder,
was never so well pleased as when in active employment.
Not that the commons left the fighting wholly to
the men of family, for they too, at the summons of the
war-bell, had to arm for the field; but at the best they
did it from a sense of duty, and, without the aid of professional
men-at-arms, they must have failed more frequently
in their enterprises, or at any rate have had to
endure a greatly prolonged absence from their counters
and workshops. And yet, esteem this advantage as highly
as we will, Florence surely lost more than it gained by
compelling the crowd of idle gentlemen to come within
its walls. In the course of time some of them indeed
condescended to engage in trade—sank, as the phrase
went, into the ranks of the <i>Popolani</i>, or mere wealthy
citizens; but the great body of them, while their landed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span>
property was being largely increased in value in consequence
of the general prosperity, held themselves
haughtily aloof from honest industry in every form.
Each family, or rather each clan of them, lived apart
in its own group of houses, from among which towers
shot aloft for scores of yards into the air, dominating
the humbler dwellings of the common burghers.
These, whenever they came to the front for a time in
the government, were used to decree that all private
towers were to be lopped down to within a certain
distance from the ground.</p>

<p>It is a favourite exercise of Villani and other historians
to trace the troubles and revolutions in the state
of Florence to chance quarrels between noble families,
arising from an angry word or a broken troth. Here,
they tell, was sown the seed of the Guelf and Ghibeline
wars in Florence; and here that of the feuds of Black
and White. Such quarrels and party names were symptoms
and nothing more. The enduring source of trouble
was the presence within the city of a powerful idle class,
constantly eager to recover the privilege it had lost,
and to secure itself by every available means, including
that of outside help, in the possession of what it
still retained; which chafed against the curbs put upon
its lawlessness, and whose ambitions were all opposed
to the general interest. The citizens, for their part, had
nothing better to hope for than that Italy should be
left to the Italians, Florence to the Florentines. On
the occasion of the celebrated Buondelmonti feud
(1215), some of the nobles definitely went over to the
side of the people, either because they judged it likely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span>
to win in the long-run, or impelled unconsciously by
the forces that in every society divide ambitious men
into two camps, and in one form or another develop
party strife. They who made a profession of popular
sympathy did it with a view of using rather than of
helping the people at large. Both of the noble parties
held the same end in sight—control of the Commonwealth;
and this would be worth the more the fewer
there were to share it. The faction irreconcilable
with the Republic on any terms included many of the
oldest and proudest houses. Their hope lay in the
advent of a strong Emperor, who should depute to them
his rights over the money-getting, low-born crowd.</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p>The opportunity of this class might seem to have
come when the Hohenstaufen Frederick <span class="smcap">II.</span>, grandson of
Barbarossa, ascended the throne, and still more when,
on attaining full age, he claimed the whole of the
Peninsula as his family inheritance. Other Emperors
had withstood the Papal claims, but none had ever
proved an antagonist like Frederick. His quarrel
seemed indeed to be with the Church itself, with its
doctrines and morals as well as with the ambition of
churchmen; and he offered the strange spectacle of a
Roman Emperor—one of the twin lights in the Christian
firmament—whose favour was less easily won by
Christian piety, however eminent, than by the learning
of the Arab or the Jew. When compelled at last to
fulfil a promise extorted from him of conducting a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span>
crusade to the Holy Land, he scandalised Christendom
by making friends of the Sultan, and by using his
presence in the East, not for the deliverance of the
Sepulchre, but for the furtherance of learning and commerce.
Thrice excommunicated, he had his revenge
by proving with how little concern the heaviest anathemas
of the Church could be met by one who was
armed in unbelief. Literature, art, and manners were
sedulously cultivated in his Sicilian court, and among
the able ministers whom he selected or formed, the
modern idea of the State may be said to have had its
birth. Free thinker and free liver, poet, warrior, and
statesman, he stood forward against the sombre background
of the Middle Ages a figure in every respect
so brilliant and original as well to earn from his contemporaries
the title of the Wonder of the World.</p>

<p>On the goodwill of Italians Frederick had the claim
of being the most Italian of all the Emperors since the
revival of the Western Empire, and the only one of
them whose throne was permanently set on Italian soil.
Yet he never won the popular heart. To the common
mind he always appeared as something outlandish and
terrible—as the man who had driven a profitable but
impious trade in the Sultan’s land. Dante, in his
childhood, must have heard many a tale of him; and
we find him keenly interested in the character of the
Emperor who came nearest to uniting Italy into a
great nation, in whose court there had been a welcome
for every man of intellect, and in whom a great original
poet would have found a willing and munificent
patron. In the <i>Inferno</i>, by the mouth of Pier delle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span>
Vigne, the Imperial Chancellor, he pronounces Frederick
to have been worthy of all honour;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> yet justice requires
him to lodge this flower of kings in the burning tomb
of the Epicureans, as having been guilty of the arch-heresy
of denying the moral government of the world,
and holding that with the death of the body all is
ended.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> It was a heresy fostered by the lives of many
churchmen, high and low; but the example of Frederick
encouraged the profession of it by nobles and learned
laymen. On Frederick’s character there was a still
darker stain than this of religious indifference—that of
cold-blooded cruelty. Even in an age which had produced
Ezzelino Romano, the Emperor’s cloaks of lead
were renowned as the highest refinement in torture.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
But, with all his genius, and his want of scruple in
the choice of means, he built nothing politically that
was not ere his death crumbling to dust. His enduring
work was that of an intellectual reformer under whose
protection and with whose personal help his native
language was refined, Europe was enriched with a
learning new to it or long forgotten, and the minds of
men, as they lost their blind reverence for Rome, were
prepared for a freer treatment of all the questions with
which religion deals. He was thus in some respects a
precursor of Dante.</p>

<p>More than once in the course of Frederick’s career
it seemed as if he might become master of Tuscany
in fact as well as in name, had Florence only been
as well affected to him as were Siena and Pisa.
But already, as has been said, the popular interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span>
had been strengthened by accessions from among
the nobles. Others of them, without descending
into the ranks of the citizens, had set their hopes
on being the first in a commonwealth rather than
privates in the Imperial garrison. These men, with
their restless and narrow ambitions, were as dangerous
to have for allies as for foes, but by throwing their
weight into the popular scale they at least served to
hold the Imperialist magnates in check, and established
something like a balance in the fighting power of
Florence; and so, as in the days of Barbarossa, the
city was preserved from taking a side too strongly. The
hearts of the Florentine traders were in their own affairs—in
extending their commerce and increasing their
territory and influence in landward Tuscany. As
regarded the general politics of Italy, their sympathy
was still with the Roman See; but it was a sympathy
without devotion or gratitude. For refusing to join in
the crusade of 1238 the town was placed under interdict
by Gregory <span class="smcap">IX.</span> The Emperor meanwhile was acknowledged
as its lawful overlord, and his vicar received
something more than nominal obedience, the choice of
the chief magistrates being made subject to his approval.
Yet with all this, and although his party was powerful
in the city, it was but a grudging service that was yielded
to Frederick. More than once fines were levied on the
Florentines; and worse punishments were threatened
for their persevering and active enmity to Siena, now
dominated by its nobles and held in the Imperial
interest. Volunteers from Florence might join the
Emperor in his Lombard campaigns; but they were left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span>
equally free by the Commonwealth to join the other
side. At last, when he was growing old, and when
like his grandfather he had been foiled by the stubborn
Lombards, he turned on the Florentines as an easier
prey, and sent word to the nobles of his party to seize
the city. For months the streets were filled with battle.
In January 1248, Frederick of Antioch, the natural
son of the Emperor, entered Florence with some squadrons
of men-at-arms, and a few days later the nobles
that had fought on the popular side were driven into
banishment. This is known in the Florentine annals
as the first dispersion of the Guelfs.</p>

<p>Long before they were adopted in Italy, the names of
Guelf and Ghibeline had been employed in Germany
to mark the partisans of the Bavarian Welf and of the
Hohenstaufen lords of Waiblingen. On Italian soil
they received an extended meaning: Ghibeline stood for
Imperialist; Guelf for anti-Imperialist, Papalist, or simply
Nationalist. When the names began to be freely used
in Florence, which was towards the close of Frederick’s
reign and about a century after their first invention,
they denoted no new start in politics, but only supplied
a nomenclature for parties already in existence. As
far as Florence was concerned, the designations were
the more convenient that they were not too closely
descriptive. The Ghibeline was the Emperor’s man,
when it served his purpose to be so; while the Guelf,
constant only in his enmity to the Ghibelines, was free
to think of the Pope as he chose, and to serve him no
more than he wished or needed to. Ultimately, indeed,
all Florence may be said to have become Guelf. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span>
begin with, the name distinguished the nobles who
sought alliance with the citizens, from the nobles who
looked on these as they might have done on serfs newly
thriven into wealth. Each party was to come up in
turn. Within a period of twenty years each was twice
driven into banishment, a measure always accompanied
with decrees of confiscation and the levelling of private
strongholds in Florence. The exiles kept well together,
retreating, as it were in the order of war, to camps of
observation they found ready prepared for them in the
nearest cities and fortresses held by those of their own
way of thinking. All their wits were then bent on
how, by dint of some fighting and much diplomacy,
they might shake the strength and undermine the credit
of their successful rivals in the city, and secure their
own return in triumph. It was an art they were proud
to be adepts in.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>In a rapid sketch like this it would be impossible to
tell half the changes made on the constitution of
Florence during the second part of the thirteenth
century. Dante in a well-known passage reproaches
Florence with the political restlessness which afflicted
her like a disease. Laws, he says, made in October
were fallen into desuetude ere mid-November.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> And
yet it may be that in this constant readiness to change,
lies the best proof of the political capacity of the
Florentines. It was to meet new necessities that they
made provision of new laws. Especial watchfulness was
called for against the encroachments of the grandees,
whose constant tendency—whatever their party name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span>—was
to weaken legal authority, and play the part of
lords and masters of the citizens. But these were no
mere weavers and quill-drivers to be plundered at will.
Even before the return of the Guelfs, banished in 1248,
the citizens, taking advantage of a check suffered in the
field by the dominant Ghibelines, had begun to recast
the constitution in a popular sense, and to organise the
townsmen as a militia on a permanent footing. When,
on the death of Frederick in 1250, the Imperialist
nobles were left without foreign aid, there began a
period of ten years, favourably known in Florentine
history as the Government of the <i>Primo Popolo</i> or
<i>Popolo Vecchio</i>; that is, of the true body of the citizens,
commoners possessed of franchises, as distinguished
from the nobles above them and the multitude below.
For it is never to be forgotten that Florence, like
Athens, and like the other Italian Republics, was far
from being a true democracy. The time was yet to
come, and it was not far distant, when the ranks of
citizenship were to be more widely opened than now to
those below, and more closely shut to those above. In
the meantime the comparatively small number of wealthy
citizens who legally composed the ‘People’ made good
use of their ten years of breathing-time, entering on
commercial treaties and widening the possessions of
the Commonwealth, now by war, and now by shrewd
bargains with great barons. To balance the influence
of the Podesta, who had hitherto been the one great
officer of State—criminal judge, civil governor, and
commander-in-chief all in one—they created the office
of Captain of the People. The office of Podesta was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span>not peculiar to Florence. There, as in other cities, in
order to secure his impartiality, it was provided that
he should be a foreigner, and hold office only for six
months. But he was also required to be of gentle
birth; and his councils were so composed that, like his
own, their sympathies were usually with the nobles.
The Captain of the People was therefore created partly
as a tribune for the protection of the popular rights,
and partly to act as permanent head of the popular
forces. Like the Podesta, he had two councils assigned
to him; but these were strictly representative of the
citizens, and sat to control his conduct as well as to
lend to his action the weight of public opinion.</p>

<p>Such of the Ghibelines as had not been banished
from Florence on the death of Frederick, lived there
on sufferance, as it were, and under a rigid supervision.
Once more they were to find a patron and ally in a
member of the great house of Hohenstaufen; and with
his aid they were again for a few years to become
supreme in Florence, and to prove by their abuse of
power how well justified was the mistrust the people
had of them. In many ways Manfred, one of Frederick’s
bastards, was a worthy son of his father. Like
him he was endowed with great personal charm, and
was enamoured of all that opened new regions to
intellectual curiosity or gave refinement to sensual
pleasure. In his public as well as in his private
behaviour, he was reckless of what the Church and its
doctrines might promise or threaten; and equally so,
his enemies declared, of the dictates of common
humanity. Hostile eyes detected in the green clothes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span>
which were his favourite dress a secret attachment to
Islam; and hostile tongues charged him with the
murder of a father and of a brother, and the attempted
murder of a nephew. His ambition did not aim at
the Empire, but only at being King of Sicily and
Naples, lands which the Hohenstaufens claimed as their
own through the Norman mother of Frederick. Of
these kingdoms he was actual ruler, even while his
legitimate brother Conrad lived. On the death of
that prince he brushed aside the claims of Conradin,
his nephew, and bid boldly for recognition by the
Pope, who claimed to be overlord of the southern
kingdoms—a recognition refused, or given only to be
immediately withdrawn. In the eyes of Rome he was
no more than Prince of Tarentum, but by arms and
policy he won what seemed a firm footing in the South;
and eight years after the rule of the <i>Popolo Vecchio</i>
began in Florence he was the acknowledged patron of
all in Italy who had been Imperialist—for the Imperial
throne was now practically vacant. And Manfred
was trusted all the more that he cared nothing for
Germany, and stood out even more purely an Italian
monarch than his father had ever been. The Ghibelines
of Florence looked to him to free them of the
yoke under which they groaned.</p>

<p>When it was discovered that they were treating with
Manfred, there was an outburst of popular wrath
against the disaffected nobles. Some of them were
seized and put to death, a fate shared by the Abbot of
Vallombrosa, whom neither his priestly office nor his
rank as Papal Legate availed to save from torture and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span>
a shameful end.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Well accustomed as was the age to
violence and cruelty, it was shocked at this free disposal
of a great ecclesiastic by a mercantile community; and
even to the Guelf chronicler Villani the terrible defeat
of Montaperti seemed no more than a just vengeance
taken by Heaven upon a crime so heinous.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> In the
meantime the city was laid under interdict, and those
concerned in the Abbot’s death were excommunicated;
while the Ghibelines, taking refuge in Siena, began to
plot and scheme with the greater spirit against foes
who, in the very face of a grave peril, had offended in
the Pope their strongest natural ally.</p>

<p>The leader of the exiles was Farinata, one of the
Uberti, a family which, so long ago as 1180, had raised
a civil war to force their way into the consulship. Ever
since, they had been the most powerful, perhaps, and
certainly the most restless, clan in Florence, rich in men
of strong character, fiercely tenacious of their purpose.
Such was Farinata. To the Florentines of a later age
he was to stand for the type of the great Ghibeline
gentleman, haughty as Lucifer, a Christian in name
though scarcely by profession, and yet almost beloved
for his frank excess of pride. It detracted nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span>
from the grandeur of his character, in the judgment of
his countrymen, that he could be cunning as well as
brave. Manfred was coy to afford help to the Tuscan
Ghibelines, standing out for an exorbitant price for the
loan of his men-at-arms; and to Farinata was attributed
the device by which his point of honour was effectually
touched.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> When at last a reinforcement of eight
hundred cavalry entered Siena, the exiles and their
allies felt themselves more than a match for the militia
of Florence, and set themselves to decoy it into the
field. Earlier in the same year the Florentines had
encamped before Siena, and sought in vain to bring
on a general engagement. They were now misled by
false messengers, primed by Farinata, into a belief that
the Sienese, weary of the arrogance of Provenzano
Salvani,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> then all-powerful in Siena, were ready to
betray a gate to them. In vain did Tegghiaio Aldobrandi,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
one of the Guelf nobles, counsel delay till the
German men-at-arms, wearied with waiting on and
perhaps dissatisfied with their wages, should be recalled
by Manfred. A march in full strength upon the hostile
city was resolved on by the eager townsmen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span></p><p>The battle of Montaperti was fought in September
1260, among the earthy hills washed by the Arbia and
its tributary rivulets, a few miles to the east of Siena.
It marked the close of the rule of the <i>Popolo Vecchio</i>.
Till then no such disastrous day had come to Florence;
and the defeat was all the more intolerable that it was
counted for a victory to Siena. Yet the battle was far
from being a test of the strength of the two rival cities.
Out of the thirty thousand foot in the Guelf army,
there were only about five thousand Florentines. In
the host which poured out on them from Siena, beside
the militia of that city and the Florentine exiles, were
included the Ghibelines of Arezzo, the retainers of
great lords still unsubdued by any city, and, above all,
the German men-at-arms of Manfred.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> But the worst
enemies of Florence were the traitors in her own ranks.
She bore it long in mind that it was her merchants
and handicraftsmen who stood stubbornly at bay, and
tinged the Arbia red with their life-blood; while it
was among the men of high degree that the traitors
were found. On one of them, Bocca degli Abati, who
struck off the right hand of the standard-bearer of the
cavalry, and so helped on the confusion and the rout,
Dante takes vengeance in his pitiless verse.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The fortifications of Florence had been recently
completed and strengthened, and it was capable of a
long defence. But the spirit of the people was broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span>
for the time, and the conquerors found the gates open.
Then it was that Farinata almost atoned for any wrong
he ever did his native town, by withstanding a proposal
made by the Ghibelines of the rival Tuscan cities, that
Florence should be destroyed, and Empoli advanced
to fill her room. ‘Alone, with open face I defended
her,’ Dante makes him say.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> But the wonder would
rather be if he had voted to destroy a city of which he
was about to be one of the tyrants. Florence had now
a fuller experience than ever of the oppression which it
was in the character of the Ghibelines to exercise. A
rich booty lay ready to their hands; for in the panic after
Montaperti crowds of the best in Florence had fled,
leaving all behind them except their wives and children,
whom they would not trust to the cruel mercy of the
victors. It was in this exile that for the first time
the industrious citizen was associated with the Guelf
noble. From Lucca, not powerful enough to grant
them protection for long, they were driven to Bologna,
suffering terribly on the passage of the Apennines from
cold and want of food, but safe when the mountains
lay between them and the Val d’Arno. While the
nobles and young men with a taste for fighting found
their livelihood in service against the Lombard Ghibelines,
the more sober-minded scattered themselves to
seek out their commercial correspondents and increase
their acquaintance with the markets of Europe. When
at length the way was open for them to return home,
they came back educated by travel, as men must always
be who travel for a purpose; and from this second exile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span>
of the Guelfs dates a vast extension of the commerce
of Florence.</p>

<p>Their return was a fruit of the policy followed by the
Papal Court The interests of both were the same.
The Roman See could have as little independence of
action while a hostile monarch was possessed of the
southern kingdoms, as the people of Florence could
have freedom while the Ghibeline nobility had for patron
a military prince, to whom their gates lay open by way
of Siena and Pisa. To Sicily and Naples the Pope laid
claim by an alternative title—they were either dependent
on the See of Rome, or, if they were Imperial fiefs, then,
in the vacancy of the Empire, the Pope, as the only head
of Christendom, had a right to dispose of them as he
would. A champion was needed to maintain the
claim, and at length the man was found in Charles of
Anjou, brother of St. Louis. This was a prince of intellectual
powers far beyond the common, of untiring
industry in affairs, pious, ‘chaste as a monk,’ and cold-hearted
as a usurer; gifted with all the qualities, in
short, that make a man feared and well served, and
with none that make him beloved. He was not one
to risk failure for want of deliberation and foresight, and
his measures were taken with such prudence that by
the time he landed in Italy his victory was almost
assured. He found his enemy at Benevento, in the
Neapolitan territory (February 1266). In order to get
time for reinforcements to come up, Manfred sought
to enter into negotiations; but Charles was ready, and
knew his advantage. He answered with the splendid
confidence of a man sure of a heavenly if he missed an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[Pg xlii]</a></span>
earthly triumph. ‘Go tell the Sultan of Lucera,’<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> was
his reply, ‘that to-day I shall send him to Hell, or he
will send me to Paradise.’ Manfred was slain, and his
body, discovered only after long search, was denied
Christian burial. Yet, excommunicated though he was,
and suspected of being at heart as much Mohammedan
as Christian, he, as well as his great rival, is found by
Dante in Purgatory.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> And, while the Christian poet
pours his invective on the pious Charles,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> he is at no
pains to hide how pitiful appeared to him the fate of
the frank and handsome Manfred, all whose followers
adored him. He, as more than once it happens in the
<i>Comedy</i> to those whose memory is dear to the poet, is
saved from Inferno by the fiction that in the hour of
death he sent one thought heavenward—‘so wide is
the embrace of infinite mercy.’<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>To Florence Charles proved a useful if a greedy and
exacting protector. Under his influence as Pacificator
of Tuscany—an office created for him by the Pope—the
Guelfs were enabled slowly to return from exile, and
the Ghibelines were gradually depressed into a condition
of dependence on the goodwill of the citizens
over whom they had so lately domineered. Henceforth
failure attended every effort they made to lift
their heads. The stubbornly irreconcilable were
banished or put to death. Elaborate provisions were
enacted in obedience to the Pope’s commands, by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[Pg xliii]</a></span>
the rest were to be at peace with their old foes. Now
they were to live in the city, but under disabilities as
regarded eligibility to offices; now they were to be represented
in the public councils, but so as to be always
in a minority. The result of the measures taken, and
of the natural drift of things, was that ere many more
years had passed there were no avowed Ghibelines in
Florence.</p>

<p>One influence constantly at work in this direction
was that of the <i>Parte Guelfa</i>, a Florentine society
formed to guard the interests of the Guelfs, and which
was possessed of the greater part of the Ghibeline
property confiscated after the triumph of Charles had
turned the balance of power in Italy. This organisation
has been well described as a state within a state, and it
seems as if the part it played in the Florentine politics
of this period were not yet fully known. This much
seems sure, that the members of the Society were
mostly Guelf nobles; that its power, derived from the
administration of vast wealth to a political end, was so
great that the Captain of the <i>Parte Guelfa</i> held a place
almost on a level with that of the chief officials of the
Commonwealth; and that it made loans of ready money
to Florence and the Pope, on condition of their being
used to the damage of the Ghibelines.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The Commonwealth, busy in resettling its government,
was but slightly interested in much that went on
around it. The boy Conradin, grandson of Frederick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[Pg xliv]</a></span>
nephew of Manfred, and in a sense the last of the
Hohenstaufens, came to Italy to measure himself with
Charles, and paid for his audacity upon the scaffold.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
Charles deputed Guy of Montfort, son of the great Earl
Simon, to be his vicar in Florence. The Pope smiled
and frowned in turn on the Florentines, as their devotion
to him waxed and waned; and so he did on his
champion Charles, whose ambition was apt to outrun his
piety. All this was of less importance to the Commonwealth
than the promotion of its domestic interests. It
saw with equanimity a check given to Charles by the
election of a new Emperor in Rudolf of Hapsburg
(1273), and a further check by the Sicilian Vespers,
which lost him half his kingdom (1283). But Siena and
Pisa, Arezzo, and even Pistoia, were the objects of a
sleepless anxiety. Pisa was the chief source of danger,
being both from sentiment and interest stubbornly
Ghibeline. When at length its power was broken by
Genoa, its great maritime rival, in the naval battle of
Meloria (1284), there was no longer any city in
Tuscany to be compared for wealth and strength with
Florence.</p>


<h4>III.</h4>

<p>It was at this period that Dante, reaching the age
of manhood, began to perform the duties that fell to
him as a youthful citizen—duties which, till the age of
thirty was reached, were chiefly those of military
service. The family to which he belonged was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[Pg xlv]</a></span>
branch of the Elisei, who are included by Villani in
the earliest catalogue given by him of the great Florentine
houses. Cacciaguida, one of the Elisei, born in
1106, married a daughter of the Aldighieri, a family
of Ferrara. Their son was christened Aldighiero, and
this was adopted by the family as a surname, afterwards
changed to Alighieri. The son of Aldighiero was
Bellincione, father of Aldighiero <span class="smcap">II.</span>, the father of Dante.</p>

<p>It serves no purpose to fill a page of biography
with genealogical details when the hero’s course in life
was in no way affected by the accident of who was his
grandfather. In the case of Dante, his position in the
State, his political creed, and his whole fashion of
regarding life, were vitally influenced by the circumstances
of his birth. He knew that his genius, and
his genius alone, was to procure him fame; he declares
a virtuous and gentle life to be the true proof of
nobility: and yet his family pride is always breaking
through. In real life, from his family’s being decayed
in wealth and fallen in consideration compared with
its neighbours, he may have been led to put emphasis
on his assertion of gentility; and amid the poverty
and humiliations of his exile he may have found a
tonic in the thought that by birth, not to speak of other
things, he was the equal of those who spurned him or
coldly lent him aid. However this may be, there is
a tacit claim of equality with them in the easy grace
with which he encounters great nobles in the world of
shades. The bent of his mind in relation to this
subject is shown by such a touch as that when he
esteems it among the glories of Francis of Assisi not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[Pg xlvi]</a></span>
have been ashamed of his base extraction.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> In Paradise
he meets his great crusading ancestor Cacciaguida, and
feigns contrition for the pleasure with which he listens
to a declaration of the unmixed purity of their common
blood.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> In Inferno he catches a glimpse, sudden and
terrible, of a kinsman whose violent death had remained
unavenged; and, for the nonce, the philosopher-poet
is nothing but the member of an injured Florentine
clan, and winces at the thought of a neglected blood
feud.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> And when Farinata, the great Ghibeline, and
haughtiest of all the Florentines of the past generation,
asks him, ‘Who were thine ancestors?’ Dante says
with a proud pretence of humility, ‘Anxious to obey, I
hid nothing, but told him all he demanded.’<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Dante was born in Florence in the May of 1265.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
A brother of his father had been one of the guards of
the Florentine Caroccio, or standard-bearing car, at the
battle of Montaperti (1260). Whether Dante’s father
necessarily shared in the exile of his party may be
doubted. He is said—on slight authority—to have
been a jurisconsult: there is no reason to suppose he
was at Montaperti. It is difficult to believe that Florence
was quite emptied of its lawyers and merchants
as a consequence of the Ghibeline victory. In any
case, it is certain that while the fugitive Guelfs were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[Pg xlvii]</a></span>mostly accompanied by their wives, and did not return
till 1267, we have Dante’s own word for it that he was
born in the great city by the Arno,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and was baptized
in the Baptistery, his beautiful St. John’s.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> At the font
he received the name of Durante, shortened, as he bore
it, into Dante. It is in this form that it finds a place
in the <i>Comedy</i>,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> once, and only once, written down of
necessity, the poet says—the necessity of being faithful
in the report of Beatrice’s words: from the wider
necessity, we may assume, of imbedding in the work itself
the name by which the author was commonly known,
and by which he desired to be called for all time.</p>

<p>When Dante was about ten years old he lost his
father. Of his mother nothing but her Christian name
of Bella is known. Neither of them is mentioned in
the <i>Comedy</i>,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> nor indeed are his wife and children.
Boccaccio describes the Alighieri as having been in
easy though not in wealthy circumstances; and Leonardo
Bruni, who in the fifteenth century sought out what he
could learn of Dante, says of him that he was possessed
of a patrimony sufficient for an honourable livelihood.
That he was so might be inferred from the character
of the education he received. His studies, says
Boccaccio, were not directed to any object of worldly
profit. That there is no sign of their having been
directed by churchmen tends to prove the existence
in his native town of a class of cultivated laymen; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[Pg xlviii]</a></span>
that there was such appears from the ease with which,
when, passing from boyhood to manhood, he felt a
craving for intellectual and congenial society, he found
in nobles of the stamp of Guido Cavalcanti men like-minded
with himself. It was indeed impossible but
that the revival of the study of the civil law, the
importation of new learning from the East, and the
sceptical spirit fostered in Italy by the influence of
Frederick II. and his court, should all have told on the
keen-witted Florentines, of whom a great proportion—even
of the common people—could read; while the
class with leisure had every opportunity of knowing
what was going on in the world.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Heresy, the rough
word for intellectual life as well as for religious aspiration,
had found in Florence a congenial soil.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> In the
thirteenth century, which modern ignorance loves to
reckon as having been in a special sense an age of
faith, there were many Florentines who, in spite of
their outward conformity, had drifted as far from
spiritual allegiance to the Church as the furthest
point reached by any of their descendants who some
two ages later belonged to the school of Florentine
Platonists.</p>

<p>Chief among these free-thinkers, and, sooth to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[Pg xlix]</a></span>
free-livers—though in this respect they were less distinguished
from the orthodox—was Brunetto Latini, for
some time Secretary to the Republic, and the foremost
Italian man of letters of his day. Meagre though his
greatest work, the <i>Tesoro</i>, or <i>Treasure</i>, must seem to
any one who now glances over its pages, to his contemporaries
it answered the promise of its title and
stood for a magazine of almost complete information
in the domains of natural history, ethics, and politics.
It was written in French, as being a more agreeable
language than Italian; and was composed, there is
reason to believe, while Latini lived in Paris as an
exiled Guelf after Montaperti. His <i>Tesoretto</i>, or <i>Little
Treasure</i>, a poem in jingling eight-syllabled Italian
verse, has been thought by some to have supplied hints
to Dante for the <i>Comedy</i>.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> By neither of these works
is he evinced a man of strong intellect, or even of good
taste. Yet there is the testimony of Villani that he did
much to refine the language of his contemporaries, and
to apply fixed principles to the conduct of State affairs.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
Dante meets him in Inferno, and hails him as his intellectual
father—as the master who taught him from
day to day how fame is to be won.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> But it is too much
to infer from these words that Latini served as his
teacher, in the common sense of the word. It is true
they imply an intimacy between the veteran scholar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[Pg l]</a></span>
and his young townsman; but the closeness of their
intercourse is perhaps best accounted for by supposing
that Latini had been acquainted with Dante’s father,
and by the great promise of Dante’s boyhood was led
to take a warm interest in his intellectual development.
Their intimacy, to judge from the tone of their conversation
down in Inferno, had lasted till Latini’s
death. But no tender reminiscence of the days they
spent together avails to save him from condemnation
at the hands of his severe disciple. By the manners
of Brunetto, and the Epicurean heresies of others of
his friends, Dante, we may be sure, was never infected
or defiled.</p>

<p>Dante describes himself as having begun the serious
study of philosophy and theology only at the mature
age of twenty-seven. But ere that time he had studied
to good effect, and not books alone, but the world
around him too, and the world within. The poet was
formed before the theologian and philosopher. From
his earliest years he was used to write in verse; and
he seems to have esteemed as one of his best endowments
the easy command of his mother tongue acquired
by him while still in boyhood.</p>

<p>Of the poems written in his youth he made a selection,
and with a commentary gave them to the world
as his first work.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> All the sonnets and canzoni contained
in it bear more or less directly on his love for
Beatrice Portinari. This lady, whose name is so in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[Pg li]</a></span>dissolubly
associated with that of Dante, was the
daughter of a rich citizen of good family. When
Dante saw her first he was a child of nine, and she
a few months younger. It would seem fabulous, he
says, if he related what things he did, and of what a
passion he was the victim during his boyhood. He
seized opportunities of beholding her, but for long
never passed beyond a silent worship; and he was
eighteen before she spoke to him, and then only in the
way of a passing salutation. On this he had a vision,
and that inspired him with a sonnet, certainly not the
first he had written, but the first he put into circulation.
The mode of publication he adopted was the common
one of sending copies of it to such other poets as were
within reach. The sonnet in itself contains a challenge
to interpret his dream. Several poets attempted the
riddle—among them the philosopher and poet Guido
Cavalcanti. They all failed in the solution; but with
some of them he was thus brought into terms of intimacy,
and with Cavalcanti of the closest friendship. Some
new grace of style in Dante’s verse, some art in the
presentation of his mystical meaning that escapes the
modern reader, may have revealed to the middle-aged
man of letters that a new genius had arisen. It was by
Guido’s advice that the poems of which this sonnet
stands the first were some years later collected and
published with the explanatory narrative. To him, in
a sense, the whole work is addressed; and it agreed
with his taste, as well as Dante’s own, that it should
contain nothing but what was written in the vulgar
tongue. Others besides Guido must have recognised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[Pg lii]</a></span>
in the little book, as it passed from hand to hand, the
masterpiece of Italian prose, as well as of Italian verse.
In the simple title of <i>Vita Nuova</i>, or <i>The New Life</i>,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
we can fancy that a claim is laid to originality of both
subject and treatment. Through the body of the work,
though not so clearly as in the <i>Comedy</i>, there rings the
note of assurance of safety from present neglect and
future oblivion.</p>

<p>It may be owing to the free use of personification
and symbol in the <i>Vita Nuova</i> that some critics, while
not denying the existence of a real Beatrice, have held
that she is introduced only to help out an allegory, and
that, under the veil of love for her, the poet would
express his youthful passion for truth. Others, going
to the opposite extreme, are found wondering why he
never sought, or, seeking, failed to win, the hand of
Beatrice. To those who would refine the Beatrice of
the early work into a being as purely allegorical as she
of the <i>Comedy</i>, it may be conceded that the <i>Vita
Nuova</i> is not so much the history of a first love as of
the new emotional and intellectual life to which a first
love, as Dante experienced it, opens the door. Out of
the incidents of their intercourse he chooses only such
as serve for motives to the joys and sorrows of the
passionate aspiring soul. On the other hand, they who
seek reasons why Dante did not marry Beatrice have
this to justify their curiosity, that she did marry another
man. But her husband was one of the rich and power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[Pg liii]</a></span>ful
Bardi; and her father was so wealthy that after
providing for his children he could endow a hospital
in Florence. The marriage was doubtless arranged as
a matter of family convenience, due regard being had
to her dower and her husband’s fortune; and we may
assume that when Dante, too, was married later on, his
wife was found for him by the good offices of his
friends.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Our manners as regards these things are not
those of the Italy of the thirteenth century. It may
safely be said that Dante never dreamed of Beatrice for
his wife; that the expectation of wedding her would
have sealed his lips from uttering to the world any
word of his love; and that she would have lost something
in his esteem if, out of love for him, she had
refused the man her father chose for her.</p>

<p>We must not seek in the <i>Vita Nuova</i> what it does
not profess to give. There was a real Beatrice Portinari,
to a careless glance perhaps not differing much
from other Florentine ladies of her age and condition;
but her we do not find in Dante’s pages. These are
devoted to a record of the dreams and visions, the new
thoughts and feelings of which she was the occasion or
the object. He worshipped at a distance, and in a
single glance found reward enough for months of
adoration; he read all heaven into a smile. So high
strung is the narrative, that did we come on any hint
of loving dalliance it would jar with all the rest She
is always at a distance from him, less a woman than
an angel.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[Pg liv]</a></span></p>
<p>In all this there is certainly as much of reticence as
of exaggeration. When he comes to speak of her death
he uses a phrase on which it would seem as if too little
value had been set. He cannot dwell on the circumstances
of her departure, he says, without being his own
panegyrist. Taken along with some other expressions
in the <i>Vita Nuova</i>, and the tone of her words to him
when they meet in the Earthly Paradise, we may gather
from this that not only was she aware of his long
devotion, but that, ere she died, he had been given to
understand how highly she rated it. And on the occasion
of her death, one described as being her nearest
relative by blood and, after Cavalcanti, Dante’s chief
friend—her brother, no doubt—came to him and
begged him to write something concerning her. It
would be strange indeed if they had never looked
frankly into one another’s faces; and yet, for anything
that is directly told in the <i>Vita Nuova</i>, they never did.</p>

<p>The chief value of the <i>Vita Nuova</i> is therefore
psychological. It is a mine of materials illustrative of
the author’s mental and emotional development, but as
regards historical details it is wanting in fulness and
precision. Yet, even in such a sketch of Dante’s life
as this tries to be, it is necessary to dwell on the turning-points
of the narrative contained in the <i>Vita Nuova</i>;
the reader always remembering that on one side Dante
says more than the fact that so he may glorify his love,
and less on another that he may not fail in consideration
for Beatrice. She is first a maiden whom no public
breath is to disturb in her virgin calm; and afterwards a
chaste wife, whose lover is as jealous of her reputation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[Pg lv]</a></span>
as any husband could be. The youthful lover had begun
by propounding the riddle of his love so obscurely
that even by his fellow-poets it had been found insoluble,
adepts though they themselves were in the art
of smothering a thought. Then, though all his longing
is for Beatrice, lest she become the subject of common
talk he feigns that he is in love first with one lady and
then with another.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> He even pushes his deceit so far
that she rebukes him for his fickleness to one of his
sham loves by denying him the customary salutation
when they meet—this salutation being the only sign of
friendship she has ever shown. It is already some few
years since the first sonnet was written. Now, in a
ballad containing a more direct avowal of his love than
he has yet ventured on,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> he protests that it was always
Beatrice his heart was busy with, and that to her, though
his eyes may have seemed to wander, his affection was
always true. In the very next poem we find him as if
debating with himself whether he shall persevere. He
weighs the ennobling influence of a pure love and the
sweetness it gives to life, against the pains and self-denial
to which it condemns its servant. Here, he tells
us in his commentary, he was like a traveller who has
come to where the ways divide. His only means of
escape—and he feels it is a poor one—is to throw
himself into the arms of Pity.</p>

<p>From internal evidence it seems reasonably certain
that the marriage of Beatrice fell at the time when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[Pg lvi]</a></span>
describes himself as standing at the parting of the ways.
Before that he has been careful to write of his love in
terms so general as to be understood only by those in
possession of the key. Now he makes direct mention of
her, and seeks to be in her company; and he even leads
us to infer that it was owing to his poems that she became
a well-known personage in the streets of Florence.
Immediately after the sonnet in which he has recourse
to Pity, he tells how he was led by a friend into the
house of a lady, married only that day, whom they find
surrounded by her lady friends, met to celebrate her
home-coming after marriage. It was the fashion for
young gentlemen to offer their services at such a feast.
On this occasion Dante for one can give no help. A
sudden trembling seizes him; he leans for support
against the painted wall of the chamber; then, lifting
his eyes to see if the ladies have remarked his plight,
he is troubled at beholding Beatrice among them,
with a smile on her lips, as, leaning towards her,
they mock at her lover’s weakness. To his friend, who,
as he leads him from the chamber, asks what ails him,
he replies: ‘My feet have reached that point beyond
which if they pass they can never return.’ It was only
matrons that gathered round a bride at her home-coming;
Beatrice was therefore by this time a married
woman. That she was but newly married we may infer
from Dante’s confusion on finding her there.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> His
secret has now been discovered, and he must either
renounce his love, or, as he is at length free to do,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">[Pg lvii]</a></span>
Beatrice being married, declare it openly, and spend
his life in loyal devotion to her as the mistress of his
imagination and of his heart.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>But how is he to pursue his devotion to her, and
make use of his new privilege of freer intercourse,
when the very sight of her so unmans him? He
writes three sonnets explaining what may seem pusillanimity
in him, and resolves to write no more. Now
comes the most fruitful episode in the history.
Questioned by a bevy of fair ladies what is the end of
a love like his, that cannot even face the object of its
desire, he answers that his happiness lies in the words
by which he shows forth the praises of his mistress. He
has now discovered that his passion is its own reward.
In other words, he has succeeded in spiritualising his
love; although to a careless reader it might seem in
little need of passing through the process. Then, soon
after, as he walks by a crystal brook, he is inspired with
the words which begin the noblest poem he had yet
produced,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and that as the author of which he is hailed
by a fellow-poet in Purgatory. It is the first to glorify
Beatrice as one in whom Heaven is more concerned
than Earth; and in it, too, he anticipates his journey
through the other world. She dies,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and we are surprised
to find that within a year of her death he wavers
in his allegiance to her memory. A fair face, expressing
a tender compassion, looks down on him from a window<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[Pg lviii]</a></span>
as he goes nursing his great sorrow; and he loves the
owner of the face because she pities him. But seeing
Beatrice in a vision he is restored, and the closing
sonnet tells how his whole desire goes forth to her, and
how his spirit is borne above the highest sphere to
behold her receiving honour, and shedding radiance on
all around her. The narrative closes with a reference
to a vision which he does not recount, but which incites
him to severe study in order that he may learn to write
of her as she deserves. And the last sentence of the
<i>Vita Nuova</i> expresses a hope—a hope which would be
arrogant coming after anything less perfect than the
<i>Vita Nuova</i>—that, concerning her, he shall yet say
things never said before of any woman. Thus the poet’s
earliest work contains an earnest of the latest, and his
morning makes one day with his evening.</p>

<p>The narrative of the <i>Vita Nuova</i> is fluent and graceful,
in this contrasting strongly with the analytical arguments
attached to the various poems. Dante treats his readers
as if they were able to catch the meaning of the most
recondite allegory, and yet were ignorant of the alphabet
of literary form. And, as is the case with other
poets of the time, the free movement of his fancy is
often hampered by the necessity he felt of expressing
himself in the language of the popular scholastic philosophy.
All this is but to say that he was a man of his
period, as well as a great genius. And even in this his
first work he bettered the example of Guido Cavalcanti,
Guido of Bologna, and the others whom he found, but did
not long suffer to remain, the masters of Italian verse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">[Pg lix]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
These inherited from the Provençal and Sicilian poets
much of the cant of which European poetry has been
so slow to clear itself; and chiefly that of presenting
all human emotion and volition under the figure of love
for a mistress, who was often merely a creature of fancy,
set up to act as Queen of Beauty while the poet ran his
intellectual jousts. But Dante dealt in no feigned
inspiration, and distinguishes himself from the whole
school of philosophical and artificial poets as ‘one who
can only speak as love inspires.’<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> He may deal in
allegory and utter sayings dark enough, but the first
suggestions of his thoughts are obtained from facts of
emotion or of real life. His lady was no creature of
fancy, but his neighbour Beatrice Portinari: and she
who ends in the <i>Paradiso</i> as the embodied beauty of
holiness was, to begin with, a fair Florentine girl.</p>

<p>The instance of Beatrice is the strongest, although
others might be adduced, to illustrate Dante’s economy
of actual experience; the skilful use, that is, of real
emotions and incidents to serve for suggestion and
material of poetical thought. As has been told,
towards the close of the <i>Vita Nuova</i> he describes how
he found a temporary consolation for the loss of Beatrice
in the pity of a fair and noble lady. In his next
work, the <i>Convito</i>, or <i>Banquet</i>, she appears as the personification
of philosophy. The plan of the <i>Convito</i> is
that of a commentary on odes which are interpreted as
having various meanings—among others the literal as
distinguished from the allegorical or essentially true.
As far as this lady is concerned, Dante shows some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">[Pg lx]</a></span>
eagerness to pass from the literal meaning; desirous, it
may be, to correct the belief that he had ever wavered
in his exclusive devotion to Beatrice. That for a time
he did transfer his thoughts from Beatrice in Heaven
to the fair lady of the window is almost certain, and by
the time he wrote the <i>Purgatorio</i> he was able to make
confession of such a fault. But at the earlier period
at which the <i>Convito</i><a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> was written, he may have come to
regard the avowal in the <i>Vita Nuova</i> as an oversight
dishonouring to himself as well as to his first love, and
so have slurred it over, leaving the fact to stand enveloped
in an allegory. At any rate, to his gloss upon
this passage in his life we are indebted for an interesting
account of how, at the age of twenty-seven, he put
himself to school:—</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘After losing the earliest joy of my life, I was so smitten
with sorrow that in nothing could I find any comfort. Yet
after some time my mind, eager to recover its tone, since
nought that I or others could do availed to restore me,
directed itself to find how people, being disconsolate, had
been comforted. And so I took to reading that little-known
book by Boethius, by writing which he, captive and
in exile, had obtained relief. Next, hearing that Tully as
well had written a book in which, treating of friendship, he
had consoled the worthy Laelius on the occasion of the
loss of his friend Scipio, I read that too. And though at
the first I found their meaning hard, at last I compre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxi" id="Page_lxi">[Pg lxi]</a></span>hended
it as far as my knowledge of the language and
some little command of mother-wit enabled me to do:
which same mother-wit had already helped me to much,
as may be seen by the <i>Vita Nuova</i>. And as it often
happens that a man goes seeking silver, and lights on gold
he is not looking for—the result of chance, or of some
divine provision; so I, besides finding the consolation I
was in search of to dry my tears, became possessed of
wisdom from authors and sciences and books. Weighing
this well, I deemed that philosophy, the mistress of these
authors, sciences, and books, must be the best of all things.
And imagining her to myself fashioned like a great lady,
rich in compassion, my admiration of her was so unbounded
that I was always delighting myself in her image. And
from thus beholding her in fancy I went on to frequent the
places where she is to be found in very deed—in the schools
of theology, to wit, and the debates of philosophers. So
that in a little time, thirty months or so, I began to taste
so much of her sweetness that the love I bore to her
effaced or banished every other thought.’<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p></div>

<p>No one would guess from this description of how he
grew enamoured of philosophy, that at the beginning of
his arduous studies Dante took a wife. She was Gemma,
the daughter of Manetto Donati, but related only distantly,
if at all, to the great Corso Donati. They were
married in 1292, he being twenty-seven; and in the course
of the nine years that elapsed till his exile she bore him
five sons and two daughters.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> From his silence regarding
her in his works, and from some words of Boccaccio’s
which apply only to the period of his exile, it has been
inferred that the union was unhappy. But Dante makes
no mention in his writings of his parents or children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii">[Pg lxii]</a></span>
any more than of Gemma.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> And why should not his
wife be included among the things dearest to him which,
he tells us, he had to leave behind him on his banishment?
For anything we know to the contrary, their
wedded life up to the time of his exile may have been
happy enough; although most probably the marriage
was one of convenience, and almost certainly Dante
found little in Gemma’s mind that answered to his own.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
In any case it is not safe to lay stress upon his silence.
During the period covered by the <i>Vita Nuova</i> he served
more than once in the field, and to this none of his
earlier works make any reference. In 1289, Arezzo
having warmly espoused the Ghibeline cause, the Florentines,
led by Corso Donati and the great merchant
Vieri dei Cerchi, took up arms and met the foe
in the field of Campaldino, on the edge of the upland
region of the Casentino. Dante, as a young man of
means and family, fought in the vanguard;<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and in a
letter partly preserved by one of his early biographers<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
he describes himself as being then no tiro in arms, and
as having with varying emotions watched the fortunes of
the day. From this it is clear that he had served before,
probably in an expedition into the Aretine territory made
in the previous year, and referred to in the <i>Inferno</i>.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
In the same year as Campaldino was won he was
pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii">[Pg lxiii]</a></span>sent at the surrender of Caprona, a fortress belonging
to Pisa.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> But of all this he is silent in his works, or
only makes casual mention of it by way of illustration.
It is, therefore, a waste of time trying to prove his
domestic misery from his silence about his marriage.</p>


<h4>IV.</h4>

<p>So hard a student was Dante that he now for a time
nearly lost the use of his eyes.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> But he was cured by
regimen, and came to see as well as ever, he tells us;
which we can easily believe was very well indeed. For
his work, as he planned it out, he needed all his powers.
The <i>Convito</i>, for example, was designed to admit of a
full treatment of all that concerns philosophy. It marks
an earlier stage of his intellectual and spiritual life than
does the opening of the <i>Inferno</i>. In it we have the
fruit of the years during which he was wandering astray
from his early ideal, misled by what he afterwards came
to count as a vain and profitless curiosity. Most of its
contents, as we have it,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> are only indirectly interesting.
It is impossible for most people to care for discussions,
conducted with all the nicety of scholastic definition,
on such subjects as the system of the universe as it was
evolved out of the brains of philosophers; the subject-matter
of knowledge; and how we know. But there is
one section of it possessed of a very special interest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiv" id="Page_lxiv">[Pg lxiv]</a></span>
the Fourth, in which he treats of the nature of nobility.
This he affirms to be independent of wealth or ancestry,
and he finds every one to be noble who practises the
virtues proper to his time of life. ‘None of the Uberti
of Florence or the Visconti of Milan can say he is
noble because belonging to such or such a race; for
the Divine seed is sown not in a family but in the
individual man.’ This amounts, it must be admitted,
to no more than saying that high birth is one thing,
and nobility of character another; but it is significant
of what were the current opinions, that Dante should
be at such pains to distinguish between the two
qualities. The canzone which supplies the text for the
treatise closes with a picture of the noble soul at
every stage of life, to which Chaucer may well have
been indebted for his description of the true gentleman:<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>—‘The
soul that is adorned by this grace does
not keep it hid, but from the day when soul is wed
to body shows it forth even until death. In early life
she is modest, obedient, and gentle, investing the outward
form and all its members with a gracious beauty:
in youth she is temperate and strong, full of love and
courteous ways, delighting in loyal deeds: in mature age
she is prudent, and just, and apt to liberality, rejoicing
to hear of others’ good. Then in the fourth stage of
life she is married again to God,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and contemplates her
approaching end with thankfulness for all the past.’<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxv" id="Page_lxv">[Pg lxv]</a></span></p><p>In this passage it is less the poet that is heard than
the sober moralist, one with a ripe experience of life,
and contemptuous of the vulgar objects of ambition.
The calm is on the surface. As has been said above,
he was proud of his own birth, the more proud perhaps
that his station was but a middling one; and to the close
of his life he hated upstarts with their sudden riches,
while the Philip Argenti on whom in the <i>Inferno</i> he
takes what has much the air of a private revenge may
have been only a specimen of the violent and haughty
nobles with whom he stood on an uneasy footing.</p>

<p>Yet the impression we get of Dante’s surroundings
in Florence from the <i>Vita Nuova</i> and other poems, from
references in the <i>Comedy</i>, and from some anecdotes
more or less true which survive in the pages of
Boccaccio and elsewhere, is on the whole a pleasant
one. We should mistake did we think of him as always
in the guise of absorbed student or tearful lover.
Friends he had, and society of various kinds. He tells
how in a severe illness he was nursed by a young and
noble lady, nearly related to him by blood—his sister
most probably; and other ladies are mentioned as
watching in his sick-chamber.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> With Forese and
Piccarda Donati, brother and sister of the great Corso
Donati, he was on terms of the warmest friendship.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
From the <i>Vita Nuova</i> we can gather that, even when
his whole heart fainted and failed at the mere sight
of Beatrice, he was a favourite with other ladies
and conversed familiarly with them. The brother of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvi" id="Page_lxvi">[Pg lxvi]</a></span>
Beatrice was his dear friend; while among those of the
elder generation he could reckon on the friendship of
such men as Guido Cavalcanti and Brunetto Latini.
Through Latini he would, even as a young man, get
the entry of the most lettered and intellectually active
society of Florence. The tradition of his intimacy
with Giotto is supported by the mention he makes of
the painter,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> and by the fact, referred to in the <i>Vita
Nuova</i>, that he was himself a draughtsman. It is to
be regretted there are not more anecdotes of him on
record like that which tells how one day as he drew
an angel on his tablets he was broken in upon by
‘certain people of importance.’ The musician Casella,
whom he ‘woes to sing in Purgatory’<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> and Belacqua,
the indolent good-humoured lutemaker,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> are greeted by
him in a tone of friendly warmth in the one case and
of easy familiarity in the other, which help us to know
the terms on which he stood with the quick-witted
artist class in Florence.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Already he was in the enjoyment
of a high reputation as a poet and scholar, and
there seemed no limit to the greatness he might attain
to in his native town as a man of action as well as a
man of thought.</p>

<p>In most respects the Florence of that day was as
fitting a home for a man of genius as could well be
imagined. It was full of a life which seemed restless
only because the possibilities of improvement for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvii" id="Page_lxvii">[Pg lxvii]</a></span>
individual and the community seemed infinite. A true
measure of its political progress and of the activity of
men’s minds is supplied by the changes then being
made in the outward aspect of the city. The duties of
the Government were as much municipal as political,
and it would have surprised a Florentine to be told
that the one kind of service was of less dignity than the
other. The population grew apace, and, to provide
the means for extending the city walls, every citizen,
on pain of his testament being found invalid, was required
to bequeath a part of his estate to the public.
Already the banks of the Arno were joined by three
bridges of stone, and the main streets were paved with
the irregularly-shaped blocks of lava still familiar to
the sojourner in Florence. But between the time of
Dante’s boyhood and the close of the century the other
outstanding features of the city were greatly altered, or
were in the course of change. The most important
churches of Florence, as he first knew it, were the
Baptistery and the neighbouring small cathedral church
of Santa Reparata; after these ranked the church of the
Trinity, Santo Stefano, and some other churches which
are now replaced by larger ones, or of which the site
alone can be discovered. On the other side of the
river, Samminiato with its elegant façade rose as now
upon its hill.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> The only great civic building was the
Palace of the Podesta. The Old Market was and had
long been the true centre of the city’s life.</p>

<p>At the time Dante went into exile Arnolfo was
already working on the great new cathedral of St. Mary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxviii" id="Page_lxviii">[Pg lxviii]</a></span>
of the Flowers, the spacious Santa Croce, and the
graceful Badia; and Santa Maria Novella was slowly
assuming the perfection of form that was later to
make it the favourite of Michel Angelo. The Palace
of the Signory was already planned, though half a
century was to elapse before its tower soared aloft to
daunt the private strongholds which bristled, fierce
and threatening, all over the city. The bell-tower
of Giotto, too, was of later erection—the only pile
we can almost regret that Dante never saw. The
architect of it was however already adorning the walls
of palace and cloister with paintings whose inspiration
was no longer, like that of the works they overshadowed,
drawn from the outworn motives of Byzantine
art, but from the faithful observation of nature.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> He in
painting and the Pisan school in sculpture were furnishing
the world with novel types of beauty in the plastic
arts, answering to the ‘sweet new style’ in verse of
which it was Dante that discovered the secret.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Florence was now by far the leading city in Tuscany.
Its merchants and money-dealers were in correspondence
with every Mediterranean port and with every country
of the West. Along with bales of goods and letters of
exchange new ideas and fresh intelligence were always
on the road to Florence. The knowledge of what was
going on in the world, and of what men were thinking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxix" id="Page_lxix">[Pg lxix]</a></span>
was part of the stock-in-trade of the quick-witted
citizens, and they were beginning to be employed
throughout Europe in diplomatic work, till then almost a
monopoly of churchmen. ‘These Florentines seem to
me to form a fifth element,’ said Boniface, who had
ample experience of how accomplished they were.</p>

<p>At home they had full employment for their political
genius; and still upon the old problem, of how to
curb the arrogance of the class that, in place of being
satisfied to share in the general prosperity, sought its
profit in the maintenance of privilege. It is necessary,
at the cost of what may look like repetition, to revert
to the presence and activity of this class in Florence,
if we are to form a true idea of the circumstances of
Dante’s life, and enter into the spirit with which much
of the <i>Comedy</i> is informed. Though many of the nobles
were now engaged in commerce and figured among
the popular leaders, most of the greater houses stood
proudly aloof from everything that might corrupt their
gentility. These were styled the magnates: they found,
as it were, a vocation for themselves in being nobles.
Among them the true distinctive spirit of Ghibelinism
survived, although none of them would now have dared
to describe himself as a Ghibeline. Their strength lay
partly in the unlimited control they retained over the
serfs on their landward estates; in the loyalty with
which the members of a family held by one another; in
their great command of resources as the administrators
of the <i>Parte Guelfa</i>; and in the popularity they enjoyed
with the smaller people in consequence of their lavish
expenditure, and frank if insolent manners. By law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxx" id="Page_lxx">[Pg lxx]</a></span>
scarcely the equals of the full citizens, in point of fact
they tyrannised over them. Their houses, set like
fortresses in the crowded streets, frequently served as
prisons and torture-chambers for the low-born traders
or artisans who might offend them.</p>

<p>Measures enough had been passed towards the
close of the century with a view to curb the insolence
of the magnates; but the difficulty was to get them put
in force. At length, in 1294, they, with many additional
reforms, were embodied in the celebrated Ordinances
of Justice. These for long were counted back
to as the Great Charter of Florence—a Great Charter
defining the popular rights and the disabilities of the
baronage. Punishments of special severity were enacted
for nobles who should wrong a plebeian, and the whole
of a family or clan was made responsible for the crimes
and liabilities of its several members. The smaller
tradesmen were conciliated by being admitted to a
share in political influence. If serfage was already
abolished in the State of Florence, it was the Ordinances
which made it possible for the serf to use his liberty.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
But the greatest blow dealt to the nobles by the new
laws was their exclusion, as nobles, from all civil and
political offices. These they could hold only by
becoming members of one of the trade guilds.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxi" id="Page_lxxi">[Pg lxxi]</a></span>
to deprive a citizen of his rights it was enough to
inscribe his name in the list of magnates.</p>

<p>It is not known in what year Dante became a member
of the Guild of Apothecaries. Without much reason it
has been assumed that he was one of the nobles who took
advantage of the law of 1294. But there is no evidence
that in his time the Alighieri ranked as magnates, and
much ground for believing that for some considerable
time past they had belonged to the order of full citizens.</p>

<p>It was not necessary for every guildsman to practise
the art or engage in the business to which his guild
was devoted, and we are not required to imagine Dante
as having anything to do with medicine or with the
spices and precious stones in which the apothecaries
traded. The guilds were political as much as industrial
associations, and of the public duties of his membership
he took his full share. The constitution of
the Republic, jealously careful to limit the power of the
individual citizen, provided that the two chief executive
officers, the Podesta and the Captain of the People,
should always be foreigners. They held office only for
six months. To each of them was assigned a numerous
Council, and before a law could be abrogated or a new
one passed it needed the approval of both these Councils,
as well as that of the Priors, and of the heads of
the principal guilds. The Priors were six in number,
one for each district of the city. With them lay the
administration in general of the laws, and the conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxii" id="Page_lxxii">[Pg lxxii]</a></span>
of foreign affairs. Their office was elective, and held
for two months.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Of one or other of the Councils
Dante is known to have been a member in 1295, 1296,
1300, and 1301.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> In 1299 he is found engaged on a
political mission to the little hill-city of San Gemigniano,
where in the town-house they still show the pulpit
from which he addressed the local senate.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> From the
middle of June till the middle of August 1300 he
served as one of the Priors.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>At the time when Dante entered on this office,
Florence was distracted by the feud of Blacks and
Whites, names borrowed from the factions of Pistoia,
but fated to become best known from their use in the
city which adopted them. The strength of the Blacks
lay in the nobles whom the Ordinances of Justice had
been designed to depress; both such of them as had
retained their standing as magnates, and such as, under
the new law, had unwillingly entered the ranks of the
citizens. Already they had succeeded in driving into
exile Giano della Bella,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> the chief author of the Ordinances;
and their efforts—and those of the citizens who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxiii" id="Page_lxxiii">[Pg lxxiii]</a></span>
fearing the growing power of the lesser guilds, were in
sympathy with them—were steadily directed to upset the
reforms. An obvious means to this end was to lower
in popular esteem the public men whose policy it was
to govern firmly on the new lines. The leader of the
discontented party was Corso Donati, a man of small
fortune, but of high birth; of splendid personal appearance,
open-handed, and of popular manners. He and
they who went with him affected a violent Guelfism,
their chance of recovering the control of domestic
affairs being the better the more they could frighten
the Florentines with threats of evils like those incurred
by the Aretines and Pisans from Ghibeline oppression.
It may be imagined what meaning the cry of Ghibeline
possessed in days when there was still a class of beggars
in Florence—men of good names—whose eyes had
been torn out by Farinata and his kind.</p>

<p>One strong claim which Corso Donati had on the
goodwill of his fellow-townsmen was that by his ready
courage in pushing on the reserves, against superior
orders, at the battle of Campaldino,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> the day had been
won to Florence and her allies. As he rode gallantly
through the streets he was hailed as the Baron (<i>il
Barone</i>), much as in the last generation the victor of
Waterloo was sufficiently distinguished as the Duke.
At the same battle, Vieri dei Cerchi, the leader of the
opposite party of the Whites, had shown no less bravery,
but he was ignorant of the art, or despised it, of making
political capital out of the performance of his duty. In
almost every respect he offered a contrast to Donati.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxiv" id="Page_lxxiv">[Pg lxxiv]</a></span>
He was of a new family, and his influence depended
not on landed possessions, though he had these too,
but on wealth derived from commerce.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> According to
John Villani, a competent authority on such a point,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
he was at the head of one of the greatest trading houses
in the world. The same crowds that cheered Corso
as the great Baron sneered at the reticent and cold-tempered
merchant as the Ghibeline. It was a strange
perversion of ideas, and yet had this of justification,
that all the nobles of Ghibeline tendency and all the
citizens who, on account of their birth, were suspected
of leaning that way were driven into the party of the
Whites by the mere fact of the Blacks hoisting so
defiantly the Guelf flag, and commanding the resources
of the <i>Parte Guelfa</i>. But if Ghibelinism meant, as fifty
years previously it did mean, a tendency to exalt
privilege as against the general liberties and to court
foreign interference in the affairs of Florence, it was
the Blacks and not the Whites who had served themselves
heirs to Ghibelinism. That the appeal was now
taken to the Pope instead of to the Emperor did not
matter; or that French soldiers in place of German
were called in to settle domestic differences.</p>

<p>The Roman See was at this time filled by Boniface
<span class="smcap">VIII.</span>, who six years previously, by violence and fraud,
had procured the resignation of Celestine <span class="smcap">V.</span>—him who
made the great refusal.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Boniface was at once arrogant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxv" id="Page_lxxv">[Pg lxxv]</a></span>
and subtle, wholly faithless, and hampered by no
scruple either of religion or humanity. But these
qualities were too common among those who before and
after him filled the Papal throne, to secure him in a
special infamy. That he has won from the ruthless
hatred which blazes out against him in many a verse of
Dante’s,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> and for this hatred he is indebted to his
interference in the affairs of Florence, and what came
as one of the fruits of it—the poet’s exile.</p>

<p>And yet, from the point of view not only of the
interest of Rome but also of Italy, there is much to be
said for the policy of Boniface. German domination
was a just subject of fear, and the Imperialist element
was still so strong in Northern and Central Italy, that
if the Emperor Albert<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> had been a man of a more
resolute ambition, he might—so contemporaries deemed—have
conquered Italy at the cost of a march through
it. The cities of Romagna were already in Ghibeline
revolt, and it was natural that the Pope should seek to
secure Florence on the Papal side. It was for the
Florentines rather than for him to judge what they
would lose or gain by being dragged into the current of
general politics. He made a fair beginning with an
attempt to reconcile the two parties. The Whites were
then the dominant faction, and to them reconciliation
meant that their foes would at once divide the govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxvi" id="Page_lxxvi">[Pg lxxvi]</a></span>ment
with them, and at the long-run sap the popular
liberties, while the Pope’s hand would soon be allowed
to dip freely into the communal purse. The policy of
the Whites was therefore one of steady opposition to all
foreign meddling with Florence. But it failed to secure
general support, for without being Ghibeline in fact it
had the air of being so; and the name of Ghibeline was
one that no reasoning could rob of its terrors.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>As was usual in Florence when political feeling ran
high, the hotter partisans came to blows, and the
streets were more than once disturbed by violence
and bloodshed. To an onlooker it must have seemed
as if the interposition of some external authority was
desirable; and almost on the same day as the new
Priors, of whom Dante was one and who were all
Whites, took office in the June of 1300, the Cardinal
Acquasparta entered the city, deputed by the Pope to
establish peace. His proposals were declined by the
party in power, and having failed in his mission he left
the city, and took the priestly revenge upon it of
placing it under interdict.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Ere many months were
passed, the Blacks, at a meeting of the heads of the
party, resolved to open negotiations anew with Boniface.
For this illegal step some of them, including
Corso Donati, were ordered into exile by the authorities,
who, to give an appearance of impartiality to their pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxvii" id="Page_lxxvii">[Pg lxxvii]</a></span>ceedings,
at the same time banished some of the Whites,
and among them Guido Cavalcanti. It was afterwards
made a charge against Dante that he had procured the
recall of his friend Guido and the other Whites from
exile; but to this he could answer that he was not then
in office.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Corso in the meantime was using his
enforced absence from Florence to treat freely with
the Pope.</p>

<p>Boniface had already entered into correspondence
with Charles of Valois, brother of Philip, the reigning
King of France, with the view of securing the services of
a strongly-connected champion. It was the game that
had been played before by the Roman Court when
Charles of Anjou was called to Italy to crush the
Hohenstaufens. This second Charles was a man of
ability of a sort, as he had given cruel proof in his
brother’s Flemish wars. By the death of his wife,
daughter of his kinsman Charles <span class="smcap">II.</span> of Naples and so
grand-daughter of Charles of Anjou, he had lost the
dominions of Maine and Anjou, and had got the nickname
of Lackland from his want of a kingdom. He
lent a willing ear to Boniface, who presented him with
the crown of Sicily on condition that he first wrested it
from the Spaniard who wore it.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> All the Papal influence
was exerted to get money for the expenses of the
descent on Sicily. Even churchmen were required to
contribute, for it was a holy war, and the hope was that
when Charles, the champion of the Church, had reduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxviii" id="Page_lxxviii">[Pg lxxviii]</a></span>
Italy to obedience, won Sicily for himself by arms, and
perhaps the Eastern Empire by marriage, he would win
the Holy Sepulchre for Christendom.</p>

<p>Charles crossed the Alps in August 1301, with five
hundred men-at-arms, and, avoiding Florence on his
southward march, found Boniface at his favourite
residence of Anagni. He was created Pacificator
of Tuscany, and loaded with other honours. What
better served the purpose of his ambition, he was urged
to retrace his steps and justify his new title by restoring
peace to Florence. There the Whites were
still in power, but they dared not declare themselves
openly hostile to the Papal and Guelf interest by refusing
him admission to the city. He came with gentle
words, and ready to take the most stringent oaths not to
tamper with the liberties of the Commonwealth; but
once he had gained an entrance (November 1301) and
secured his hold on Florence, he threw off every disguise,
gave full play to his avarice, and amused himself with
looking on at the pillage of the dwellings and warehouses
of the Whites by the party of Corso Donati. By
all this, says Dante, Charles ‘gained no land,’ Lackland
as he was, ‘but only sin and shame.’<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>There is a want of precise information as to the
events of this time. But it seems probable that Dante
formed one of an embassy sent by the rulers of Florence
to the Pope in the autumn of this year; and that on the
occasion of the entrance of Charles he was absent from
Florence. What the embassy had to propose which
Boniface could be expected to be satisfied with, short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxix" id="Page_lxxix">[Pg lxxix]</a></span>
of complete submission, is not known and is not easy
to guess. It seems clear at least that Dante cannot
have been chosen as a person likely to be specially
pleasing to the Roman Court. Within the two years preceding
he had made himself prominent in the various
Councils of which he was a member, by his sturdy
opposition to affording aid to the Pope in his Romagnese
wars. It is even possible that his theory of the
Empire was already more or less known to Boniface, and
as that Pontiff claimed Imperial authority over such
states as Florence, this would be sufficient to secure
him a rough reception.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Where he was when the
terrible news came to him that for some days there
had been no law in Florence, and that Corso Donati
was sharing in the triumph of Charles, we do not know.
Presageful of worse things to come, he did not seek to
return, and is said to have been in Siena when he heard
that, on the 27th January 1302, he had been sentenced
to a heavy fine and political disabilities for having
been guilty of extortion while a Prior, of opposing the
coming of Charles, and of crimes against the peace of
Florence and the interest of the <i>Parte Guelfa</i>. If the
fine was not paid within three days his goods and property
were to be confiscated. This condemnation he
shared with three others. In the following March he
was one of twelve condemned, for contumacy, to be
burned alive if ever they fell into the hands of the
Florentine authorities. We may perhaps assume that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxx" id="Page_lxxx">[Pg lxxx]</a></span>
the cruel sentence, as well as the charge of peculation,
was uttered only in order to conform to some respectable
precedents.</p>


<h4>V.</h4>

<p>Besides Dante many other Whites had been expelled
from Florence.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Whether they liked it or not, they
were forced to seek aid from the Ghibelines of Arezzo
and Romagna. This led naturally to a change of
political views, and though at the time of their banishment
all of them were Guelfs in various degrees, as
months and years went on they developed into Ghibelines,
more or less declared. Dissensions, too, would be
bred among them out of recriminations touching the
past, and charges of deserting the general interest for
the sake of securing private advantage in the way of
making peace with the Republic. For a time, however,
the common desire of gaining a return to Florence held
them together. Of the Council constituted to bring
this about, Dante was a member. Once only with his
associates does he appear to have come the length of
formal negotiations with a view to getting back. Charles
of Valois had passed away from the temporary scene
of his extortions and treachery, upon the futile quest
of a crown. Boniface, ere being persecuted to death
by his old ally, Philip of France (1303), had vainly
attempted to check the cruelty of the Blacks; and
Benedict, his successor, sent the Cardinal of Ostia to
Florence with powers to reconcile the two parties.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxi" id="Page_lxxxi">[Pg lxxxi]</a></span>
Dante is usually credited with the composition of the
letter in which Vieri dei Cerchi and his fellow-exiles
answered the call of the Cardinal to discuss the conditions
of their return home. All that had been done
by the banished party, said the letter, had been done
for the public good.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> The negotiations came to nothing;
nor were the exiles more fortunate in arms. Along
with their allies they did once succeed by a sudden
dash in penetrating to the market-place, and Florence
lay within their grasp when, seized with panic, they
turned and fled from the city, which many of them
were never to see again.</p>

<p>Almost certainly Dante took no active part in this
attempt, and indeed there is little to show that he was
ever heartily associated with the exiles. In his own
words, he was compelled to break with his companions
owing to their imbecility and wickedness, and to form a
party by himself.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> With the Whites, then, he had little
more to do; and the story of their fortunes need not
longer detain us. It is enough to say that while, like
Dante, the chief men among them were for ever excluded
from Florence, the principles for which they had contended
survived, and even obtained something like a
triumph within its walls. The success of Donati and
his party, though won with the help of the people, was
too clearly opposed to the popular interest to be
permanent. Ere long the inveterate contradiction between
magnate and merchant was again to change the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxii" id="Page_lxxxii">[Pg lxxxii]</a></span>
course of Florentine politics; the disabilities against
lawless nobles were again to be enforced; and Corso
Donati himself was to be crushed in the collision of
passions he had evoked but could not control (1308).
Though tenderly attached to members of his family,
Dante bore Corso a grudge as having been the chief
agent in procuring his exile—a grudge which years
could do nothing to wipe out. He places in the
mouth of Forese Donati a prophecy of the great
Baron’s shameful death, expressed in curt and scornful
words, terrible from a brother.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> It is no figure of
speech to say that Dante nursed revenge.</p>

<p>For some few years his hopes were set on Henry of
Luxemburg, elected Emperor in 1308. A Ghibeline,
in the ordinary sense of the term, Dante never was.
We have in his <i>De Monarchia</i> a full account of the
conception he had formed of the Empire—that of
authority in temporal affairs embodied in a just ruler,
who, being already supreme, would be delivered from
all personal ambition; who should decree justice and
be a refuge for all that were oppressed. He was to
be the captain of Christian society and the guardian of
civil right; as in another sphere the Pope was to be
the shepherd of souls and the guardian of the deposit
of Divine truth. In Dante’s eyes the one great officer
was as much God’s vicegerent as the other. While the
most that a Ghibeline or a moderate Guelf would
concede was that there should be a division of power
between Pope and Emperor—the Ghibeline leaving it
to the Emperor and the Guelf to the Pope to define<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxiii" id="Page_lxxxiii">[Pg lxxxiii]</a></span>
their provinces—Dante held, and in this he stood
almost alone among politicians, that they ought to be
concerned with wholly different kingdoms, and that
Christendom was wronged by the trespass of either
upon the other’s domain. An equal wrong was done
by the neglect by either of his duty, and both, as
Dante judged, had been shamefully neglecting it. For
more than half a century no Emperor had set foot in
Italy; and since the Papal Court had under Clement <span class="smcap">V.</span>
been removed to Avignon (1305), the Pope had ceased
to be a free agent, owing to his neighbourhood to
France and the unscrupulous Philip.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>Dante trusted that the virtuous single-minded
Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span> would prove a monarch round whom all
the best in Italy might gather to make him Emperor
in deed as well as in name. His judgment took the
colour of his hopes, for under the awful shadow of the
Emperor he trusted to enter Florence. Although no
Ghibeline or Imperialist in the vulgar sense, he constituted
himself Henry’s apologist and herald; and in
letters addressed to the ‘wicked Florentines,’ to the
Emperor, and to the Princes and Peoples of Italy, he
blew as it were a trumpet-blast of triumph over the
Emperor’s enemies and his own. Henry had crossed
the Alps, and was tarrying in the north of Italy, when
Dante, with a keen eye for where the key of the situation
lay, sharpened by his own wishes, urged him to lose no
more time in reducing the Lombard cities to obedience,
but to descend on Florence, the rotten sheep which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxiv" id="Page_lxxxiv">[Pg lxxxiv]</a></span>
corrupting all the Italian flock. The men of Florence
he bids prepare to receive the just reward of their crimes.</p>

<p>The Florentines answered Dante’s bitter invective
and the Emperor’s milder promises by an unwearied
opposition with the arms which their increasing command
of all that tends to soften life made them now
less willing to take up, and by the diplomacy in
which they were supreme The exiles were recalled,
always excepting the more stubborn or dangerous;
and among these was reckoned Dante. Alliances
were made on all hands, an art which Henry was
notably wanting in the trick of. Wherever he
turned he was met and checkmated by the Florentines,
who, wise by experience, were set on retaining
control of their own affairs. After his coronation
at Rome (1312),<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> he marched northwards, and with
his Pisan and Aretine allies for six weeks laid fruitless
siege to Florence. King Robert of Naples, whose aid
he had hoped to gain by means of a family alliance,
was joined to the league of Guelfs, and Henry passed
away from Florence to engage in an enterprise
against the Southern Kingdom, a design cut short by
his death (1313). He was the last Emperor that ever
sought to take the part in Italian affairs which on Dante’s
theory belonged to the Imperial office. Well-meaning
but weak, he was not the man to succeed in reducing
to practice a scheme of government which had broken
down even in the strong hands of the two Fredericks,
and ere the Commonwealths of Italy had become each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxv" id="Page_lxxxv">[Pg lxxxv]</a></span>
as powerful as a Northern kingdom. To explain his
failure, Dante finds that his descent into Italy was unseasonable:
he came too soon. Rather, it may be
said, he came far too late.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>When, on the death of Henry, Dante was disappointed
in his hopes of a true revival of the
Empire, he devoted himself for a time to urging
the restoration of the Papal Court to Rome, so
that Italy might at least not be left without some
centre of authority. In a letter addressed to the Italian
Cardinals, he besought them to replace Clement <span class="smcap">V.</span>,
who died in 1314,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> by an Italian Pope. Why should
they, he asked, resign this great office into Gascon
hands? Why should Rome, the true centre of Christendom,
be left deserted and despised? His appeal
was fruitless, as indeed it could not fail to be with
only six Italian Cardinals in a College of twenty-four;
and after a vacancy of two years the Gascon
Clement was succeeded by another Gascon. Although
Dante’s motives in making this attempt were doubtless
as purely patriotic as those which inspired Catherine
of Siena to similar action a century later, he met, we
may be sure, with but little sympathy from his former
fellow-citizens. They were intent upon the interests of
Florence alone, and even of these they may sometimes
have taken a narrow view. His was the wider patriot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxvi" id="Page_lxxxvi">[Pg lxxxvi]</a></span>ism
of the Italian, and it was the whole Peninsula that
he longed to see delivered from French influence and
once more provided with a seat of authority in its
midst, even if it were only that of spiritual power.
The Florentines for their part, desirous of security
against the incursions of the northern horde, were
rather set on retaining the goodwill of France than
on enjoying the neighbourhood of the Pope. In this
they were guilty of no desertion of their principles.
Their Guelfism had never been more than a mode of
minding themselves.</p>

<p>For about three years (1313-1316) the most dangerous
foe of Florence was Uguccione de la Faggiuola, a
partisan Ghibeline chief, sprung from the mountain-land
of Urbino, which lies between Tuscany and Romagna.
He made himself lord of Pisa and Lucca, and defeated
the Florentines and their allies in the great battle of
Montecatini (1315). To him Dante is believed to have
attached himself.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> It would be easy for the Republic to
form an exaggerated idea of the part which the exile
had in shaping the policy or contributing to the success
of his patron; and we are not surprised to find that,
although Dante’s fighting days were done, he was
after the defeat subjected to a third condemnation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxvii" id="Page_lxxxvii">[Pg lxxxvii]</a></span>
(November 1315). If caught, he was to lose his
head; and his sons, or some of them, were threatened
with the same fate. The terms of the sentence
may again have been more severe than the intentions
of those who uttered it. However this may
be, an amnesty was passed in the course of the following
year, and Dante was urged to take advantage of it.
He found the conditions of pardon too humiliating.
Like a malefactor he would require to walk, taper in
hand and a shameful mitre on his head, to the church
of St John, and there make an oblation for his crimes.
It was not in this fashion that in his more hopeful
hours the exile had imagined his restoration. If ever
he trod again the pavement of his beautiful St John’s,
it was to be proudly, as a patriot touching whom his
country had confessed her sins; or, with a poet’s more
bashful pride, to receive the laurel crown beside the
font in which he was baptized. But as he would not
enter his well beloved, well hated Florence on the
terms imposed by his enemies, so he never had the
chance of entering it on his own. The spirit in which
he, as it were, turned from the open gates of his native
town is well expressed in a letter to a friend, who
would seem to have been a churchman who had tried
to win his compliance with the terms of the pardon.
After thanking his correspondent for his kindly eagerness
to recover him, and referring to the submission
required, he says:—‘And is it in this glorious fashion
that Dante Alighieri, wearied with an almost trilustral
exile, is recalled to his country? Is this the desert of
an innocence known to all, and of laborious study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxviii" id="Page_lxxxviii">[Pg lxxxviii]</a></span>
which for long has kept him asweat?... But, Father,
this is no way for me to return to my country by;
though if by you or others one can be hit upon through
which the honour and fame of Dante will take no hurt,
it shall be followed by me with no tardy steps. If by
none such Florence is to be entered, I will never enter
Florence. What then! Can I not, wherever I may
be, behold the sun and stars? Is not meditation upon
the sweetness of truth as free to me in one place as
another? To enjoy this, no need to submit myself
ingloriously and with ignominy to the State and People
of Florence! And wherever I may be thrown, in any
case I trust at least to find daily bread.’</p>

<p>The cruelty and injustice of Florence to her greatest
son have been the subject of much eloquent blame.
But, in justice to his contemporaries, we must try to see
Dante as they saw him, and bear in mind that the very
qualities fame makes so much of—his fervent temper
and devotion to great ideas—placed him out of the
reach of common sympathy. Others besides him had
been banished from Florence, with as much or as little
reason, and had known the saltness of bread which has
been begged, and the steepness of strange stairs. The
pains of banishment made them the more eager to have
it brought to a close. With Dante all that he suffered
went to swell the count of grievances for which a
reckoning was some day to be exacted. The art of
returning was, as he himself knew well, one he was slow
to learn.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> His noble obstinacy, which would stoop to
no loss of dignity or sacrifice of principle, must excite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxix" id="Page_lxxxix">[Pg lxxxix]</a></span>
our admiration; it also goes far to account for his
difficulty in getting back. We can even imagine that
in Florence his refusal to abate one tittle of what was
due to him in the way of apology was, for a time, the
subject of wondering speculation to the citizens, ere
they turned again to their everyday affairs of politics
and merchandise. Had they been more used to deal
with men in whom a great genius was allied to a
stubborn sense of honour, they would certainly have
left less room in their treatment of Dante for happier
ages to cavil at.</p>

<p>How did the case stand? In the letter above quoted
from, Dante says that his innocence was known to
all. As far as the charge of corruption in his office-bearing
went, his banishment—no one can doubt it
for a moment—was certainly unjust; and the political
changes in Florence since the death of Corso Donati
had taken all the life out of the other charges. But by
his eager appeals to the Emperor to chastise the Florentines
he had raised fresh barriers against his return.
The governors of the Republic could not be expected
to adopt his theory of the Empire and share his views
of the Imperial claims; and to them Dante must have
seemed as much guilty of disloyalty to the Commonwealth
in inviting the presence of Henry, as Corso
Donati had been in Dante’s eyes for his share in bringing
Charles of Valois to harry Florence. His political
writings since his exile—and all his writings were more
or less political—had been such as might well confirm
or create an opinion of him as a man difficult to live
with, as one whose intellectual arrogance had a ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xc" id="Page_xc">[Pg xc]</a></span>
organ in his unsparing tongue or pen. Rumour would
most willingly dwell upon and distort the features of
his character and conduct that separated him from the
common herd. And to add to all this, even after he
had deserted the party of the Whites in exile, and
had become a party to himself, he found his friends
and patrons—for where else could he find them?—among
the foes of Florence.</p>


<h4>VI.</h4>

<p>History never abhors a vacuum so much as when she
has to deal with the life of a great man, and for those
who must have details of Dante’s career during the
nineteen years which elapsed between his banishment
and his death, the industry of his biographers has
exhausted every available hint, while some of them
press into their service much that has only the remotest
bearing on their hero. If even one-half of their
suppositions were adopted, we should be forced to the
conclusion that the <i>Comedy</i> and all the other works of
his exile were composed in the intervals of a very busy
life. We have his own word for this much, (<i>Convito</i> i. 3,)
that since he was cast forth out of Florence—in which
he would ‘fain rest his wearied soul and fulfil his
appointed time’—he had been ‘a pilgrim, nay, even a
mendicant,’ in every quarter of Italy,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> and had ‘been
held cheap by many who, because of his fame, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xci" id="Page_xci">[Pg xci]</a></span>
looked to find him come in another guise.’ But he
gives no journal of his wanderings, and, as will have
been observed, says no word of any country but Italy.
Keeping close to well-ascertained facts, it seems established
that in the earlier period of his exile he
sojourned with members of the great family of the
Counts Guidi,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> and that he also found hospitality with
the Malaspini,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> lords of the Val di Magra, between
Genoa and Lucca. At a still earlier date (August
1306) he is found witnessing a deed in Padua. It
was most probably in the same year that Dante found
Giotto there, painting the walls of the Scrovegni
Chapel, and was courteously welcomed by the artist,
and taken to his house.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> At some time of his life he
studied at Bologna: John Villani says, during his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xcii" id="Page_xcii">[Pg xcii]</a></span>
exile.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Of his supposed residence in Paris, though it
is highly probable, there is a want of proof; of a visit
to England, none at all that is worth a moment’s consideration.
Some of his commentators and biographers
seem to think he was so short-witted that he must
have been in a place before it could occur to him to
name it in his verse.</p>

<p>We have Dante’s own word for it that he found his
exile almost intolerable. Besides the bitter resentment
which he felt at the injustice of it, he probably cherished
the conviction that his career had been cut short
when he was on the point of acquiring great influence
in affairs. The illusion may have been his—one not
uncommon among men of a powerful imagination—that,
given only due opportunity, he could mould the
active life of his time as easily as he moulded and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xciii" id="Page_xciii">[Pg xciii]</a></span>
fashioned the creations of his fancy. It was, perhaps,
owing to no fault of his own that when a partial opportunity
had offered itself, he failed to get his views
adopted in Florence; indeed, to judge from the kind of
employment in which he was more than once engaged
for his patrons, he must have been possessed of no little
business tact. Yet, as when his feelings were deeply
concerned his words knew no restraint, so his hopes
would partake of the largeness of his genius. In the
restored Empire, which he was almost alone in longing
for as he conceived of it, he may have imagined for
himself a place beside Henry like what in Frederick’s
court had been filled by Pier delle Vigne—the man
who held both keys to the Emperor’s heart, and
opened and shut it as he would.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Thus, as his exile ran on it would grow sadder with
the accumulating memories of hopes deferred and
then destroyed, and of dreams which had faded away
in the light of a cheerless reality. But some consolations
he must have found even in the conditions of his
exile. He had leisure for meditation, and time enough
to spend in that other world which was all his own.
With the miseries of a wanderer’s life would come not
a few of its sweets—freedom from routine, and the intellectual
stimulus supplied by change of place. Here
and there he would find society such as he cared for—that
of scholars, theologians, and men familiar with every
court and school of Christendom. And, beyond all,
he would get access to books that at home he might
never have seen. It was no spare diet that would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xciv" id="Page_xciv">[Pg xciv]</a></span>
serve his mind while he was making such ample calls
on it for his great work. As it proceeds we seem to
detect a growing fulness of knowledge, and it is by
reason of the more learned treatment, as well as the
loftier theme of the Third Cantica, that so many
readers, when once well at sea in the <i>Paradiso</i>, recognise
the force of the warning with which it begins.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>What amount of intercourse he was able to maintain
with Florence during his wanderings is a matter of mere
speculation, although of a more interesting kind than
that concerned with the chronology of his uneasy travels.
That he kept up at least some correspondence with
his friends is proved by the letter regarding the terms
of his pardon. There is also the well-known anecdote
told by Boccaccio as to the discovery and despatch to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xcv" id="Page_xcv">[Pg xcv]</a></span>
him of the opening Cantos of the <i>Inferno</i>—an anecdote
we may safely accept as founded on fact, although
Boccaccio’s informants may have failed to note at the
time what the manuscript consisted of, and in the
course of years may have magnified the importance of
their discovery. With his wife he would naturally
communicate on subjects of common interest—as, for
instance, that of how best to save or recover part of his
property—and especially regarding the welfare of his
sons, of whom two are found to be with him when he
acquires something like a settlement in Verona.</p>

<p>It is quite credible that, as Boccaccio asserts, he would
never after his exile was once begun ‘go to his wife or
suffer her to join him where he was;’ although the
statement is probably an extension of the fact that she
never did join him. In any case it is to make too large
a use of the words to find in them evidence, as has
frequently been done, of the unhappiness of all his
married life, and of his utter estrangement from Gemma
during his banishment. The union—marriage of
convenience though it was—might be harmonious
enough as long as things went moderately well with the
pair. Dante was never wealthy, but he seems to have
had his own house in Florence and small landed
possessions in its neighbourhood.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> That before his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xcvi" id="Page_xcvi">[Pg xcvi]</a></span>
banishment he was considerably in debt appears to be
ascertained;<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> but, without knowing the circumstances
in which he borrowed, it is impossible to be sure
whether he may not only have been making use of his
credit in order to put out part of his means to advantage
in some of the numerous commercial enterprises in
which his neighbours were engaged. In any case his
career must have seemed full of promise till he was
driven into banishment. When that blow had fallen,
it is easy to conceive how what if it was not mutual
affection had come to serve instead of it—esteem and
forbearance—would be changed into indifference with
the lapse of months and years of enforced separation,
embittered and filled on both sides with the mean cares
of indigence, and, it may be, on Gemma’s side with the
conviction that her husband had brought her with himself
into disgrace. If all that is said by Boccaccio and
some of Dante’s enemies as to his temperament and
behaviour were true, we could only hope that Gemma’s
indifference was deep enough to save her from the
pangs of jealousy. And on the other hand, if we are to
push suspicion to its utmost length, we may find an
allusion to his own experience in the lines where Dante
complains of how soon a widow forgets her husband.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
But this is all matter of the merest speculation. Gemma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xcvii" id="Page_xcvii">[Pg xcvii]</a></span>
is known to have been alive in 1314.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> She brought up
her children, says Boccaccio, upon a trifling part of her
husband’s confiscated estate, recovered on the plea that
it was a portion of her dowry. There may have been
difficulties of a material kind, insuperable save to an
ardent love that was not theirs, in the way of Gemma’s
joining her husband in any of his cities of refuge.</p>

<p>Complete evidence exists of Dante’s having in his
later years lived for a longer or shorter time in the
three cities of Lucca, Verona, and Ravenna. In
Purgatory he meets a shade from Lucca, in the murmur
of whose words he catches he ‘knows not what of
Gentucca;’<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> and when he charges the Lucchese to
speak plainly out, he is told that Lucca shall yet be
found pleasant by him because of a girl not yet grown
to womanhood. Uguccione, acting in the interest of
Pisa, took possession of Lucca in 1314, and Dante is
supposed to have taken up his residence there for some
considerable time. What we may certainly infer from
his own words in the <i>Purgatorio</i> is that they were
written after a stay in Lucca had been sweetened to
him by the society of a lady named Gentucca. He
cannot well have found shelter there before the city was
held by Uguccione; and research has established that
at least two ladies of the uncommon name of Gentucca<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xcviii" id="Page_xcviii">[Pg xcviii]</a></span>
were resident there in 1314. From the whole tone of
his allusion—the mention of her very name and of her
innocent girlhood—we may gather that there was
nothing in his liking for her of which he had any
reason to feel ashamed. In the <i>Inferno</i> he had covered
the whole people of Lucca with his scorn.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> By the
time he got thus far with the <i>Purgatorio</i> his thoughts
of the place were all softened by his memory of one
fair face—or shall we rather say, of one compassionate
and womanly soul? That Dante was more than
susceptible to feminine charms is coarsely asserted by
Boccaccio.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> But on such a matter Boccaccio is
a prejudiced witness, and, in the absence of sufficient
proof to the contrary, justice requires us to assume
that the tenor of Dante’s life was not at variance
with that of his writings. He who was so severe a
judge of others was not, as we can infer from more
than one passage of the <i>Comedy</i>, a lenient judge
when his own failings were concerned.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> That his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xcix" id="Page_xcix">[Pg xcix]</a></span>
conduct never fell short of his standard no one will
venture to maintain. But what should have hindered
him, in his hours of weariness and when even his
hold on the future seemed to slacken, in lonely
castle or strange town, to seek sympathy from some
fair woman who might remind him in something of
Beatrice?<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>When, in 1316, Uguccione was driven out of Lucca
and Pisa, that great partisan took military service with
Can Grande. It has been disputed whether Dante had
earlier enjoyed the hospitality of the Scaligers, or was
indebted for his first reception in Verona to the good
offices of Uguccione. It is barely credible that by this
time in his life he stood in need of any one to answer
for him in the court of Can Grande. His fame as a
political writer must have preceded him; and it was of
a character to commend him to the good graces of the
great Imperialist. In his <i>De Monarchia</i> he had, by an
exhaustive treatment of propositions which now seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_c" id="Page_c">[Pg c]</a></span>
childish or else the mere commonplaces of everyday
political argument, established the right of the civil
power to independence of Church authority; and
though to the Scaliger who aimed at becoming Imperial
lieutenant for all the North of Italy he might
seem needlessly tender to the spiritual lordship of the
Holy Father, yet the drift of his reasoning was all in
favour of the Ghibeline position.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Besides this he
had written on the need of refining the dialects of Italian,
and reducing them to a language fit for general use in
the whole of the Peninsula; and this with a novelty of
treatment and wealth of illustration unequalled before
or since in any first work on such a subject.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> And,
what would recommend him still more to a youthful
prince of lofty taste, he was the poet of the ‘sweet new
style’ of the <i>Vita Nuova</i>, and of sonnets, ballads, and
canzoni rich in language and thought beyond the
works of all previous poets in the vulgar tongues.
Add to this that the <i>Comedy</i> was already written, and
published up, perhaps, to the close of the <i>Purgatorio</i>,
and that all Italy was eager to find who had a place,
and what kind of place, in the strange new world from
which the veil was being withdrawn; and it is easy to
imagine that Dante’s reception at Can Grande’s court
was rather that of a man both admired and feared for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ci" id="Page_ci">[Pg ci]</a></span>
his great genius, than that of a wandering scholar and
grumbling exile.</p>

<p>At what time Dante came to Verona, and for
how long he stayed, we have no means of fixing with
certainty. He himself mentions being there in 1320,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
and it is usually supposed that his residence covered
three years previous to that date; as also that it was
shared by his two sons, Piero and Jacopo. One of
these was afterwards to find a settlement at Verona in a
high legal post. Except some frivolous legends, there is
no evidence that Dante met with anything but generous
treatment from Can Grande. A passage of the <i>Paradiso</i>,
written either towards the close of the poet’s residence
at Verona, or after he had left it, is full of a praise of
the great Scaliger so magnificent<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> as fully to make
amends for the contemptuous mention in the <i>Purgatorio</i>
of his father and brother.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> To Can Grande the <i>Paradiso</i>
was dedicated by the author in a long epistle containing
an exposition of how the first Canto of that
Cantica, and, by implication, the whole of the poem, is
to be interpreted. The letter is full of gratitude for
favours already received, and of expectation of others
yet to come. From the terms of the dedication it has
been assumed that ere it was made the whole of the
<i>Paradiso</i> was written, and that Dante praises the lord of
Verona after a long experience of his bounty.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cii" id="Page_cii">[Pg cii]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether owing to the restlessness of an exile, or to
some prospect of attaining a state of greater ease or of
having the command of more congenial society, we
cannot tell; but from the splendid court of Can Grande
he moved down into Romagna, to Ravenna, the city
which of all in Italy would now be fixed upon by the
traveller as the fittest place for a man of genius, weighed
down by infinite sorrows, to close his days in and find
a tomb. Some writers on the life of Dante will have
it that in Ravenna he spent the greater part of his
exile, and that when he is found elsewhere—in Lucca
or Verona—he is only on a temporary absence from his
permanent home.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> But this conclusion requires some
facts to be ignored, and others unduly dwelt on. In
any case his patron there, during at least the last year
or two of his life, was Guido Novello of Polenta, lord of
Ravenna, the nephew of her who above all the persons
of the <i>Comedy</i> lives in the hearts of its readers.</p>

<p>Bernardino, the brother of Francesca and uncle of
Guido, had fought on the side of Florence at the battle
of Campaldino, and Dante may then have become
acquainted with him. The family had the reputation of
being moderate Guelfs; but ere this the exile, with his
ripe experience of men, had doubtless learned, while retaining
intact his own opinions as to what was the true
theory of government, to set good-heartedness and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ciii" id="Page_ciii">[Pg ciii]</a></span>
noble aim in life above political orthodoxy. This Guido
Novello—the younger Guido—bears the reputation of
having been well-informed, of gentle manners, and fond
of gathering around him men accomplished in literature
and the fine arts. On the death of Dante he made a
formal oration in honour of the poet. If his welcome
of Dante was as cordial as is generally supposed, and
as there is no reason to doubt that it was, it proved his
magnanimity; for in the <i>Purgatorio</i> a family specially
hostile to the Polentas had been mentioned with
honour,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> while that to which his wife belonged had been
lightly spoken of. How he got over the condemnation
of his kinswoman to Inferno—even under such gentle
conditions—it would be more difficult to understand
were there not reason to believe that ere Dante went
to Ravenna it had come to be a matter of pride in Italy
for a family to have any of its members placed anywhere
in that other world of which Dante held the
key.</p>

<p>It seems as if we might assume that the poet’s last
months or years were soothed by the society of his
daughter—the child whom he had named after the
object of his first and most enduring love.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Whether
or not he was acting as Ambassador for Guido to
Venice when he caught his last illness, it appears to be
pretty well established that he was held in honour by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_civ" id="Page_civ">[Pg civ]</a></span>
patron and all around him.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> For his hours of meditation
he had the solemn churches of Ravenna with
their storied walls,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> and the still more solemn pine
forest of Classis, by him first annexed to the world of
Romance.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> For hours of relaxation, when they came,
he had neighbours who dabbled in letters and who
could at any rate sympathise with him in his love of
study. He maintained correspondence with poets and
scholars in other cities. In at least one instance this
was conducted in the bitter fashion with which
the humanists of a century or two later were to make
the world familiar;<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> but with the Bolognese scholar,
Giovanni del Virgilio, he engaged in a good-humoured,
half-bantering exchange of Latin pastoral poems, through
the artificial imagery of which there sometimes breaks
a natural thought, as when in answer to the pedant’s
counsel to renounce the vulgar tongue and produce in
Latin something that will entitle him to receive the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cv" id="Page_cv">[Pg cv]</a></span>
laurel crown in Bologna, he declares that if ever he
is crowned as a poet it will be on the banks of the
Arno.</p>

<p>Most of the material for forming a judgment of how
Dante stood affected to the religious beliefs of his time
is to be gathered from the <i>Comedy</i>, and the place for
considering it would rather be in an essay on that work
than in a sketch of his life which necessity compels to
be swift. A few words may however be here devoted
to the subject, as it is one with some bearing on the
manner in which he would be regarded by those around
him, and through that on the tenor of his life. That
Dante conformed to Church observances, and, except
with a few malevolent critics, bore the reputation of
a good Catholic, there can be no doubt. It was as a
politician and not as a heretic that he suffered persecution;
and when he died he was buried in great honour
within the Franciscan Church at Ravenna. Some few
years after his death, it is true, his <i>De Monarchia</i> was
burned as heretical by orders of the Papal Legate in
Lombardy, who would gladly, if he could, have had the
bones of the author exhumed to share the fate of his
book. But all this was only because the partisans of
Lewis of Bavaria were making political capital out of the
treatise.</p>

<p>Attempts have been made to demonstrate that in
spite of his outward conformity Dante was an unbeliever
at heart, and that the <i>Comedy</i> is devoted to
the promulgation of a Ghibeline heresy—of which, we
may be sure, no Ghibeline ever heard—and to the
overthrow of all that the author professed most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cvi" id="Page_cvi">[Pg cvi]</a></span>
devoutly to believe.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Other critics of a more sober
temper in speculation would find in him a Catholic
who held the Catholic beliefs with the same slack grasp
as the teaching of Luther was held by Lessing or
Goethe.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> But this is surely to misread the <i>Comedy</i>,
which is steeped from beginning to end in a spirit of the
warmest faith in the great Christian doctrines. It was
no mere intellectual perception of these that Dante had—or
professed to have—for when in Paradise he has
satisfied Saint Peter of his being possessed of a just conception
of the nature of faith, and is next asked if,
besides knowing what is the alloy of the coin and the
weight of it, he has it in his own purse, he answers
boldly, ‘Yea, and so shining and round that of a surety
it has the lawful stamp.’<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> And further on, when required
to declare in what he believes, nothing against the fulness
of his creed is to be inferred from the fact that he
stops short after pronouncing his belief in the existence
of God and in the Trinity. This article he gives as
implying all the others; it is ‘the spark which spreads
out into a vivid flame.’<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>Yet if the inquiry were to be pushed further, and it
were sought to find how much of free thought he
allowed himself in matters of religion, Dante might be
discovered to have reached his orthodox position by
ways hateful to the bigots who then took order for preserving
the purity of the faith. The office of the Pope
he deeply revered, but the Papal absolution avails<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cvii" id="Page_cvii">[Pg cvii]</a></span>
nothing in his eyes compared with one tear of heartfelt
repentance.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> It is not on the word of Pope or
Council that he rests his faith, but on the Scriptures,
and on the evidences of the truth of Christianity, freely
examined and weighed.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Chief among these evidences,
it must however be noted, he esteemed the fact of the
existence of the Church as he found it;<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> and in his
inquiries he accepted as guides the Scholastic Doctors
on whose reasonings the Church had set its seal of
approbation. It was a foregone conclusion he reached
by stages of his own. Yet that he sympathised at least
as much with the honest search for truth as with the
arrogant profession of orthodoxy, is shown by his treatment
of heretics. He could not condemn severely
such as erred only because their reason would not
consent to rest like his in the prevalent dogmatic
system; and so we find that he makes heresy consist
less in intellectual error than in beliefs that tend to
vitiate conduct, or to cause schism in societies divinely
constituted.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> For his own part, orthodox although he
was, or believed himself to be—which is all that needs
to be contended for,—in no sense was he priest-ridden.
It was liberty that he went seeking on his great
journey;<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> and he gives no hint that it is to be gained by
the observance of forms or in submission to sacerdotal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cviii" id="Page_cviii">[Pg cviii]</a></span>
authority. He knows it is in his reach only when he
has been crowned, and mitred too, lord of himself<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>—subject
to Him alone of whom even Popes were
servants.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>Although in what were to prove his last months
Dante might amuse himself with the composition of
learned trifles, and in the society and correspondence
of men who along with him, if on lines apart from his,
were preparing the way for the revival of classical
studies, the best part of his mind, then as for long
before, was devoted to the <i>Comedy</i>; and he was counting
on the suffrages of a wider audience than courts
and universities could supply.</p>

<p>Here there is no room to treat at length of that work,
to which when we turn our thoughts all else he wrote—though
that was enough to secure him fame—seems to
fall into the background as if unworthy of his genius.
What can hardly be passed over in silence is that in the
<i>Comedy</i>, once it was begun, he must have found a refuge
for his soul from all petty cares, and a shield against all
adverse fortune. We must search its pages, and not
the meagre records of his biographers, to find what was
the life he lived during the years of his exile; for, in a
sense, it contains the true journal of his thoughts, of his
hopes, and of his sorrows. The plan was laid wide
enough to embrace the observations he made of nature
and of man, the fruits of his painful studies, and the
intelligence he gathered from those experienced in
travel, politics, and war. It was not only his imagination

for the great Matilda than for any other. The one strong argument
against her is, that while she died old, in the poem she
appears as young.</p></div>

Dante, but as is often the case with books on the subject, his
shows a considerable gap between the evidence adduced and the
conclusions drawn from it. He would make Dante to have been
for many years a satellite of the great Ghibeline chief. Dante’s
temper or pride, however we call it, seems to have been such as
to preserve him from ever remaining attached for long to any
patron.</p></div>

dated in 1311, from ‘Near the sources of the Arno’—that is, from
the Casentino, where the Guidi of Romena dwelt. If the letter of
condolence with the Counts Oberto and Guido of Romena on the
death of their uncle is genuine, it has great value for the passage
in which he excuses himself for not having come to the funeral:—‘It
was not negligence or ingratitude, but the poverty into which
I am fallen by reason of my exile. This, like a cruel persecutor,
holds me as in a prison-house where I have neither horse nor
arms; and though I do all I can to free myself, I have failed as
yet.’ The letter has no date. Like the other ten or twelve

on the <i>Comedy</i> (<i>Purg.</i> xi.). The portrait of Dante by Giotto,

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_105_105" id="Footnote_105_105"></a><a href="#FNanchor_105_105"><span class="label">[105]</span></a> It is true that Villani not only says that ‘he went to study at
Bologna,’ but also that ‘he went to Paris and many parts of the
world’ (<i>Cronica</i>, ix. 136), and that Villani, of all contemporary or
nearly contemporary writers, is by far the most worthy of credence.
But he proves to be more than once in error regarding Dante;
making him, <i>e.g.</i>, die in a wrong month and be buried in a wrong
church at Ravenna. And the ‘many parts of the world’ shows
that here he is dealing in hearsay of the vaguest sort. Nor can
much weight be given to Boccaccio when he sends Dante to
Bologna and Paris. But Benvenuto of Imola, who lectured on
the <i>Comedy</i> at Bologna within fifty years of Dante’s death, says
that Dante studied there. It would indeed be strange if he did
not, and at more than one period, Bologna being the University
nearest Florence. Proof of Dante’s residence in Paris has been
found in his familiar reference to the Rue du Fouarre (<i>Parad.</i>
x. 137). His graphic description of the coast between Lerici and
Turbia (<i>Purg.</i> iii. 49, iv. 25) certainly seems to show a familiarity
with the Western as well as the Eastern Rivieras of Genoa.
But it scarcely follows that he was on his way to Paris when he
visited them.</p></div>

craft, ... put not further to sea, lest, losing sight of me, you lose
yourselves’ (<i>Parad.</i> ii. 1). But, to tell the truth, Dante is never so
weak as a poet as when he is most the philosopher or the theologian.
The following list of books more or less known to him is not
given as complete:—The Vulgate, beginning with St. Jerome’s
Prologue; Aristotle, through the Latin translation then in vogue;
Averroes, etc.; Thomas Aquinas and the other Schoolmen;
much of the Civil and Canon law; Boethius; Homer only in
scraps, through Aristotle, etc.; Virgil, Cicero in part, Livy,
Horace, Ovid, Terence, Lucan, and Statius; the works of Brunetto
Latini; the poetical literature of Provence, France, and Italy,
including the Arthurian Romances—the favourite reading of the
Italian nobles, and the tales of Charlemagne and his Peers—equally
in favour with the common people. There is little
reason to suppose that among the treatises of a scientific and
quasi-scientific kind that he fell in with, and of which he was an
eager student, were included the works of Roger Bacon. These
there was a conspiracy among priests and schoolmen to keep
buried. Dante seems to have set little store on ecclesiastical legends
of wonder; at least he gives them a wide berth in his works.</p></div>

father’s.—Notes to Chap. iii. Fraticelli’s admirable Life is now

as equivalent to 37,000 francs, <i>i.e.</i> nearly £1500. But the florin
being the eighth of an ounce, or about ten shillings’ worth of gold,
a thousand florins would be equal only to £500—representing, of
course, an immensely greater sum now-a-days.</p></div>

written probably in the earlier years of his exile, he tells how his
purpose of renouncing ladies’ society and the writing of love-songs
had been upset by the view of a lady of marvellous beauty who ‘in
all respects answered to his tastes, habits, and circumstances.’ He
says he sends with the letter a poem containing a fuller account of
his subjection to this new passion. The poem is not found
attached to the copy of the letter, but with good reason it is guessed
to be the Canzone beginning <i>Amor, dacchè convien</i>, which
describes how he was overmastered by a passion born ‘in the
heart of the mountains in the valley of that river beside which he
had always been the victim of love.’ This points to the Casentino
as the scene. He also calls the Canzone his ‘mountain song.’
The passion it expresses may be real, but that he makes the most
of it appears from the close, which is occupied by the thought of
how the verses will be taken in Florence.</p></div>

<p>Vasari, in his <i>Lives of the Painters</i>, tells that in his
day the portrait of Dante by Giotto was still to be
seen in the chapel of the Podesta’s palace in Florence.
Writers of an earlier date had already drawn attention
to this work.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> But in the course of an age when
Italians cared little for Dante, and less for Giotto, it
was allowed to be buried out of sight; and when at
length there came a revival of esteem for these great
men, the alterations in the interior arrangement of the
palace were found to have been so sweeping that it
was even uncertain which out of many chambers had
formerly served as the chapel. Twenty years after a
fruitless attempt had been made to discover whether
or not the portrait was still in existence, Signor Aubrey
Bezzi, encouraged by Mr. Wilde and Mr. Kirkup, took
the first step in a search (1839) which was to end by
restoring to the world what is certainly the most inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cxi" id="Page_cxi">[Pg cxi]</a></span>esting
of all portraits, if account be taken of its beauty,
as well as of who was its author and who its subject.</p>

<p>On the removal from it of a layer of lime, one of the
end walls of what had been the chapel was found to
be covered by a fresco painting, evidently the work of
Giotto, and representing a Paradise—the subject in
which Dante’s portrait was known to occur. As is
usual in such works, from the time of Giotto downwards,
the subject is treated so as to allow of the free
introduction of contemporary personages. Among
these was a figure in a red gown, which there was no
difficulty in recognising as the portrait of Dante. It
shows him younger and with a sweeter expression than
does Raphael’s Dante, or Masaccio’s,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> or that in the
Cathedral of Florence,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> or that of the mask said to
have been taken after his death. But to all of them
it bears a strong resemblance.</p>

<p>The question of when this portrait was painted will
easily be seen to be one of much importance in connection
with Dante’s biography. The fresco it belongs
to is found to contain a cardinal, and a young man,
who, because he wears his hair long and has a coronet
set on his cap, is known to be meant for a French
prince.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> If, as is usually assumed, this prince is
Charles of Valois, then the date of the event celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cxii" id="Page_cxii">[Pg cxii]</a></span>
in the fresco is 1301 or 1302. With regard to when
the work was executed, Messrs Crowe and Cavalcaselle,
in their valuable book, say as follows:<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘All inferences to be deduced from the subject and form
of these frescos point to the date of 1301-2. It may be
inquired whether they were executed by Giotto at the time,
and this inquiry can only be satisfied approximatively. It
may be inferred that Dante’s portrait would hardly have
been introduced into a picture so conspicuously visible as
this, had not the poet at the time been influent in Florence....
Dante’s age in the fresco corresponds with the date of
1302, and is that of a man of thirty-five. He had himself
enjoyed the highest office of Florence from June to August
1300.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> In the fresco he does not wear the dress of the
“Priori,” but he holds in the ranks of those near Charles
of Valois an honourable place. It may be presumed that
the frescos were executed previous<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> to Dante’s exile, and
this view is confirmed by the technical and artistic progress
which they reveal. They exhibit, indeed, the master in a
higher sphere of development than at Assisi and Rome.’</p></div>

<p>This account of the subject of the work and the
probable date of its execution may, I think, be accepted
as containing all that is to be said in favour of
the current opinion on the matter. That writer after
writer has adopted that opinion without a sign of doubt
as to its credibility must surely have arisen from failure
to observe the insuperable difficulties it presents.</p>

<p>Both Charles of Valois and the Cardinal Acquasparta
were in Florence during part of the winter of 1301-1302;
but the circumstances under which they were
there make it highly improbable that the Common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cxiii" id="Page_cxiii">[Pg cxiii]</a></span>wealth
was anxious to do them honour beyond granting
them the outward show of respect which it would have
been dangerous to refuse. Earlier in the year 1301
the Cardinal Acquasparta, having failed in gaining the
object which brought him to Florence, had, as it were,
shaken the dust of the city from off his feet and left
the people of it under interdict. While Charles of
Valois was in Florence the Cardinal returned to make
a second attempt to reconcile the opposing parties,
failed a second time, and again left the city under an
interdict—if indeed the first had ever been raised. On
the occasion of his first visit, the Whites, who were
then in power, would have none of his counsels; on
his second, the Blacks in their turn despised them.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
There would therefore have been something almost
satirical in the compliment, had the Commonwealth
resolved to give him a place in a triumphal picture.</p>

<p>As for Charles of Valois, though much was expected
from an alliance with him while he was still at a distance,
the very party that invited his presence was soon disgusted
with him owing to his faithlessness and greed.
The earlier part of his stay was disturbed by pillage and
bloodshed. Nor is it easy to imagine how, at any time
during his residence of five months, the leading citizens
could have either the time or the wish to arrange for
honouring him in a fashion he was not the man to care
for. His one craving was for money, and still more
money; and any leisure the members of public bodies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cxiv" id="Page_cxiv">[Pg cxiv]</a></span>
had to spare from giving heed to their own interests and
securing vengeance upon their opponents, was devoted
to holding the common purse shut as tightly as they
could against their avaricious Pacificator. When he at
last delivered the city from his presence no one would
have the heart to revive the memory of his disastrous
visit.</p>

<p>But if, in all this confusion of Florentine affairs, Giotto
did receive a commission to paint in the palace of the
Podesta, yet it remains incredible that he should have
been suffered to assign to Dante, of all men, a place of
honour in the picture. No citizen had more stubbornly
opposed the policy which brought Charles of Valois to
Florence, and that Charles was in the city was reason
enough for Dante to keep out of it. In his absence, he
was sentenced in January 1302 to pay a ruinously heavy
fine, and in the following March he was condemned to
be put to death if ever he was caught. On fuller
acquaintance his fellow-citizens liked the Frenchman as
little as he, but this had no effect in softening their dislike
or removing their fear of Dante. We may be sure
that any friends he may still have had in Florence, as
their influence could not protect his goods from confiscation
or him from banishment, would hardly care to risk
their own safety by urging, while his condemnation was
still fresh, the admission of his portrait among those of
illustrious Florentines.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> It is true that there have been
instances of great artists having reached so high a pitch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cxv" id="Page_cxv">[Pg cxv]</a></span>
of fame as to be able to dictate terms to patrons, however
exalted. In his later years Giotto could perhaps
have made such a point a matter of treaty with his
employers, but in 1301 he was still young,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> and great
although his fame already was, he could scarcely have
ventured to insist on the Republic’s confessing its
injustice to his friend; as it would have done had it
consented that Dante, newly driven into exile, should
obtain a place of honour in a work painted at the
public cost.</p>

<p>These considerations seem to make it highly improbable
that Giotto’s wall-painting was meant to do
honour to Charles of Valois and the Cardinal Acquasparta.
But if it should still be held that it was painted
in 1302, we must either cease to believe, in spite of all
that Vasari and the others say, that the portrait is
meant for Dante; or else confess it to be inexplicable
how it got there. A way out of the difficulty begins to
open up as soon as we allow ourselves some latitude in
speculating as to when Giotto may have painted the
fresco. The order in which that artist’s works were
produced is very imperfectly settled; and it may easily
be that the position in Vasari’s pages of the mention
made by him of this fresco has given rise to a misunderstanding
regarding the date of it. He speaks of it at
the very beginning of his Life of Giotto. But this he
does because he needs an illustration of what he has been
saying in his opening sentences about the advance that
painter made on Cimabue. Only after making mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cxvi" id="Page_cxvi">[Pg cxvi]</a></span>
of Dante’s portrait does he begin his chronological list
of Giotto’s works; to the portrait he never returns, and
so, as far as Vasari is concerned, it is without a date.
Judging of it by means of Mr. Kirkup’s careful and
beautiful sketch—and unfortunately we have now no
other means of knowing what the original was like—it
may safely be asserted to be in Giotto’s ripest style.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
Everything considered, it is therefore allowable to
search the Florentine chronicles lower down for an
event more likely to be the subject of Giotto’s fresco
than that usually fixed upon.</p>

<p>We read in John Villani that in the middle of
the year 1326 the Cardinal Gianni Orsini came to
Florence as Papal Legate and Pacificator of Tuscany.
The city was greatly pleased at his coming, and as
an earnest of gratitude for his services presented him
with a cup containing a thousand florins.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> A month
later there arrived Charles Duke of Calabria, the eldest
son of King Robert of Naples, and great-grandson of
Charles of Anjou. He came as Protector of the
Commonwealth, which office—an extraordinary one,
and with a great salary attached to it—he had been
elected to hold for five years. Never before had a
spectacle like that of his entry been offered to Florence.
Villani gives a long list of the barons who rode in his
train, and tells that in his squadrons of men-at-arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cxvii" id="Page_cxvii">[Pg cxvii]</a></span>
there were no fewer than two hundred knights. The
chronicler pauses to bid the reader note how great an
enterprise his fellow-citizens had shown in bringing to
sojourn among them, and in their interest, not only such
a powerful lord as the Duke of Calabria was, but a
Papal Legate as well. Italy counted it a great thing,
he says, and he deems that the whole world ought to
know of it.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Charles took up his abode in the Podesta’s
palace. He appears to have gained a better place in
the hearts of the Florentines than what they were used
to give to strangers and princes. When a son was born
to him, all the city rejoiced, and it mourned with him
when, in a few weeks, he lost the child. After seventeen
months’ experience of his rule the citizens were sorry to
lose him, and bade him a farewell as hearty as their welcome
had been. To some of them, it is true, the policy
seemed a dangerous one which bore even the appearance
of subjecting the Republic to the Royal House of
Naples; and some of them could have wished that he
‘had shown more vigour in civil and military affairs.
But he was a gentle lord, popular with the townsfolk,
and in the course of his residence he greatly improved
the condition of things in Florence, and brought to a
close many feuds.’<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> They felt that the nine hundred
thousand gold florins spent on him and his men had,
on the whole, been well laid out.</p>

<p>One detail of the Duke’s personal appearance deserves
remark. We have seen that the prince in the fresco
has long hair. John Villani had known the Duke well
by sight, and when he comes to record his death and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cxviii" id="Page_cxviii">[Pg cxviii]</a></span>
describe what kind of man he was to look upon, he
specially says that ‘he wore his hair loose.’<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>A subject worthy of Giotto’s pencil, and one likely to
be offered to him if he was then in Florence, we have
therefore found in this visit of the Duke and the Cardinal.
But that Giotto was in Florence at that time is
certain. He painted a portrait<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> of the Duke in the
Palace of the Signory; and through that prince, as
Vasari tells, he was invited by King Robert to go down
to work in Naples. All this, in the absence of evidence
of any value in favour of another date, makes it, at the
very least, highly probable that the fresco was a work of
1326 or 1327.</p>

<p>In 1326 Dante had been dead for five years. The
grudge his fellow-townsmen had nourished against him
for so long was now worn out. We know that very soon
after his death Florence began to be proud of him;
and even such of his old enemies as still survived would
be willing that Giotto should set him in a place of
honour among the great Florentines who help to fill
the fresco of the Paradise. That he was already dead
would be no hindrance to his finding room alongside
of Charles of Calabria; for the age was wisely tolerant
of such anachronisms.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Had Dante been still living
the painter would have been less at liberty to create,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cxix" id="Page_cxix">[Pg cxix]</a></span>
out of the records he doubtless possessed of the
features of the friend who had paid him beforehand
with one immortal line, the face which, as we look into
it, we feel to be a glorified transcript of what it was in
the flesh. It is the face of one who has wellnigh forgotten
his earthly life, instead of having the worst of it
still before him; of one who, from that troubled Italy
which like his own Sapia he knew but as a pilgrim, has
passed to the ‘true city,’ of which he remains for evermore
a citizen—the city faintly imaged by Giotto upon
the chapel wall.</p>

(iv. 23), comparing human life
to an arch, Dante says that at
the age of thirty-five a man has
reached the top and begins to
go down. As he was born in
1265 that was his own age in
1300, the year in which the
action of the poem is laid.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_161_161" id="Footnote_161_161"></a><a href="#FNanchor_161_161"><span class="label">[161]</span></a> <i>Darksome wood</i>: A state of
spiritual darkness or despair into
which he has gradually drifted,
not without fault of his own.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_162_162" id="Footnote_162_162"></a><a href="#FNanchor_162_162"><span class="label">[162]</span></a> <i>A hill</i>: Lower down this
hill is termed ‘the origin and
cause of all joy.’ It is symbolical
of spiritual freedom—of the
peace and security that spring
from the practice of virtue.
Only, as it seems, by gaining
such a vantage-ground can he
escape from the wilderness of
doubt—the valley of the shadow
of death—in which he is lost.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_163_163" id="Footnote_163_163"></a><a href="#FNanchor_163_163"><span class="label">[163]</span></a> <i>That planet</i>: On the Ptolemaic
system, which, as perfected
by the Arabian astronomers, and
with some Christian additions,
was that followed by Dante, the
sun is reckoned as one of the
seven planets; all the others as
well as the earth and the fixed
stars deriving their light from it.
Here the sunlight may signify
the Divine help granted to all
men in their efforts after virtue.</p></div>

leopard and the lion and
wolf that come with it are suggested
by Jeremiah v. 6: ‘A
lion out of the forest shall slay
them,’ etc. We have Dante’s
own authority for it, in his letter
to Can Grande, that several
meanings are often hidden under
the incidents of the <i>Comedy</i>.
But whatever else the beasts
may signify, their chief meaning
is that of moral hindrances. It
is plain that the lion and wolf
are the sins of others—pride and
avarice. If the leopard agrees
with them in this, it most probably
stands for the envy of
those among whom Dante lived:
at <i>Inf.</i> vi. 74 we find envy,
pride, and avarice classed together
as the sins that have
corrupted Florence. But from
<i>Inf.</i> xvi. 106 it appears that
Dante hoped to get the better
of the leopard by means of a
cord which he wore girt about
his loins. The cord is emblematical
of self-control; and hence
the leopard seems best to answer
the idea of sensual pleasure
in the sense of a temptation that
makes difficult the pursuit of
virtue. But it will be observed
that this hindrance Dante trusts
to overcome.</p></div>

of Friday the 25th of March
in the year 1300, and by the use
of Florence, which began the
year on the anniversary of the
incarnation, it is the first day
of the New Year. The Good
Friday of 1300 fell a fortnight
later; but the 25th of March
was held to be the true anniversary
of the crucifixion as well
as of the incarnation and of
the creation of the world. The
date of the action is fixed by
<i>Inf.</i> xxi. 112. The day was
of good omen for success in
the struggle with his lower
self.</p></div>

in the <i>Comedy</i> to represent
avarice. Dante may have
had specially in his mind the
greed and worldly ambition of
the Pope and the Court of

for a sin, and not for a
person or corporate body.</p></div>

even consul when Virgil was
born.  But Dante reckoned
Julius as the founder of the
Empire, and therefore makes the
time in which he flourished his.
Virgil was only twenty-five years
of age when Cæsar was slain;
and thus it was under Augustus
that his maturer life was
spent.</p></div>

author as ‘one worthy to be
believed and obeyed’ (<i>Convito</i>
iv. 6). For a guide and companion
on his great pilgrimage he
chooses Virgil, not only because
of his fame as a poet, but also
because he had himself described
a descent to the Shades—had
been already there. The
vulgar conception of Virgil was
that of a virtuous great magician.</p></div>

least of Dante’s minor works
had been given to the world
before 1300, certainly the <i>Vita
Nuova</i> and others of his poems.
To his study of Virgil he may
have felt himself indebted for
the purity of taste that kept him
superior to the frigid and artificial
style of his contemporaries,
He prided himself on suiting
his language to his theme, as
well as on writing straight from
the heart.</p></div>

Who the deliverer was that
Dante prophesies the coming
of is not known, and perhaps
never can be. Against the
claims of Can Grande of Verona
the objection is that, at any
date which can reasonably be
assigned for the publication of
the <i>Inferno</i>, he had done nothing
to justify such bright hopes
of his future career. There
seems proof, too, that till the
<i>Paradiso</i> was written Dante
entertained no great respect for
the Scala family (<i>Purg.</i> xvi.
118, xviii. 121). Neither is Verona,
or the widest territory over
which Can Grande ever ruled,
at all described by saying it lay
between Feltro and Feltro.—I
have preferred to translate <i>nazi-one</i>
as birth rather than as nation
or people. ‘The birth of the
deliverer will be found to have
been between feltro and feltro.’
Feltro, as Dante wrote it, would
have no capital letter; and
according to an old gloss the
deliverer is to be of humble
birth; <i>feltro</i> being the name of
a poor sort of cloth. This interpretation
I give as a curiosity
more than anything else; for
the most competent critics have
decided against it, or ignored it.—Henry
of Luxemburg, chosen
Emperor in November 1308, is
an old claimant for the post of
the allegorical <i>veltro</i> or greyhound.
On him Dante’s hopes
were long set as the man who
should ‘save Italy;’ and it
seems not out of place to draw
attention to what is said of him
by John Villani, the contemporary
and fellow-townsman of
Dante: ‘He was of a magnanimous
nature, though, as regarded
his family, of poor extraction’
(<i>Cronica</i>, ix. 1). Whatever
may be made of the Feltros, the
description in the text of the deliverer
as one superior to all personal
ambition certainly answers
better to Dante’s ideal of a righteous
Emperor than to the character
of a partisan leader like Uguccione
della Faggiuola, or an ambitious
prince like Can Grande.</p></div>

will be seen from the next Canto,
Virgil has been sent to the relief
of Dante; but how that is to be
wrought out is left to his own
judgment. He might secure a
partial deliverance for his ward
by conducting him up the Delectable
Mount—the peaceful
heights familiar to himself, and
which are to be won by the
practice of natural piety. He
chooses the other course, of
guiding Dante through the
regions of the future state,
where the pilgrim’s trust in
the Divine government will be
strengthened by what he sees,
and his soul acquire a larger
peace.</p></div>

has not mentioned Saint Peter.
Dante names him as if to proclaim
that it is as a Christian, though
under heathen guidance, that he
makes the pilgrimage. Here the
gate seems to be spoken of as if it
formed the entrance to Paradise,
as it was popularly believed to
do, and as if it were at that
point Virgil would cease to
guide him. But they are to
find it nearer at hand, and after
it has been passed Virgil is to
act as guide through Purgatory.</p></div>

of the Friday. It comes on us
with something of a surprise
that a whole day has been spent
in the attempt to ascend the
hill, and in conference with
Virgil.</p></div>

though in company with
Virgil, a shade. In these
words is to be found the keynote
to the Canto. With the
sense of deliverance from immediate
danger his enthusiasm
has died away. After all,
Virgil is only a shade; and his
heart misgives him at the
thought of engaging, in the
absence of all human companionship,
upon a journey so
full of terrors. He is not reassured
till Virgil has displayed
his commission.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_185_185" id="Footnote_185_185"></a><a href="#FNanchor_185_185"><span class="label">[185]</span></a> <i>Muses</i>: The invocation
comes now, the First Canto
being properly an introduction.
Here it may be pointed out,
as illustrating the refinement
of Dante’s art, that the invocation
in the <i>Purgatorio</i> is in a
higher strain, and that in the
<i>Paradiso</i> in a nobler still.</p></div>

whose visit to the world of
shades is described in the Sixth
<i>Æneid</i>. He finds there his father
Anchises, who foretells to him

down to the time of Augustus.</p></div>

language slightly apologetic as
he unfolds to Virgil, the great
Imperialist poet, the final cause
of Rome and the Empire. But
while he thus exalts the Papal
office, making all Roman history
a preparation for its establishment,
Dante throughout his
works is careful to refuse any
but a spiritual or religious allegiance
to the Pope, and leaves
himself free, as will be frequently
seen in the course of the <i>Comedy</i>,
to blame the Popes as men, while
yielding all honour to their great
office. In this emphatic mention
of Rome as the divinely-appointed
seat of Peter’s Chair
may be implied a censure on the
Pope for the transference of the
Holy See to Avignon, which was
effected in 1305, between the
date assigned to the action of the
poem and the period when it
was written.</p></div>

like Æneas visited the other
world, though not the same
region of it. Throughout the

history, and even poetry
and mythology, are given as of
authority equal to those from
Christian sources.</p></div>

of the <i>Vita Nuova</i>, at the
close of which Dante promises
some day to say of her what was
never yet said of any woman.
She died in 1290, aged twenty-four.
In the <i>Comedy</i> she fills
different parts: she is the glorified
Beatrice Portinari whom
Dante first knew as a fair Florentine
girl; but she also represents
heavenly truth, or the knowledge
of it—the handmaid of
eternal life. Theology is too
hard and technical a term to
bestow on her. Virgil, for his
part, represents the knowledge
that men may acquire of Divine
law by the use of their reason,
helped by such illumination as
was enjoyed by the virtuous
heathen. In other words, he is
the exponent of the Divine revelation
involved in the Imperial
system—for the Empire was
never far from Dante’s thoughts.
To him it meant the perfection
of just rule, in which due cognisance
is taken of every right
and of every duty. The relation
Dante bears to these two is that
of erring humanity struggling to
the light. Virgil leads him as
far as he can, and then commits
him to the holier rule of
Beatrice. But the poem would
lose its charm if the allegorical
meaning of every passage were
too closely insisted on. And,
worse than that, it cannot always
be found.</p></div>

Lucia Ubaldini may be meant,
a thirteenth-century Florentine
saint, and sister of the Cardinal

to her memory was the 30th of
May. Dante was born in May,
and if it could be proved that he
was born on the 30th of the
month the suggestion would be
plausible. But for the greater
Lucy is to be said that she was
especially helpful to those
troubled in their eyesight, as
Dante was at one time of his
life. Here she is the symbol of
illuminating grace.</p></div>

old Italian for vassal; and to take
the reference to be to the duty

in need seems to give
force to the appeal.</p></div>

‘horror’ be read, the meaning

Dante. He feigns astonishment

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_212_212" id="Footnote_212_212"></a><a href="#FNanchor_212_212"><span class="label">[212]</span></a> <i>The great refusal</i>: Dante
recognises him, and so he who
made the great refusal must have
been a contemporary. Almost
beyond doubt Celestine V. is
meant, who was in 1294 elected
Pope against his will, and resigned
the tiara after wearing it
a few months; the only Pope
who ever resigned it, unless
we count Clement I. As he
was not canonized till 1326,
Dante was free to form his
own judgment of his conduct.
It has been objected that Dante
would not treat with contumely
a man so devout as
Celestine. But what specially
fits him to be the representative
caitiff is just that, being himself
virtuous, he pusillanimously
threw away the greatest opportunity
of doing good. By his
resignation Boniface <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> became
Pope, to whose meddling
in Florentine affairs it was
that Dante owed his banishment.
Indirectly, therefore, he
owed it to the resignation of
Celestine; so that here we have
the first of many private scores
to be paid off in the course of
the <i>Comedy</i>. Celestine’s resignation
is referred to (<i>Inf.</i> xxvii.
104).—Esau and the rich young
man in the Gospel have both
been suggested in place of Celestine.
To either of them there
lies the objection that Dante
could not have recognised him.
And, besides, Dante’s contemporaries
appear at once to have
discovered Celestine in him who
made the great refusal. In
Paradise the poet is told by his
ancestor Cacciaguida that his
rebuke is to be like the wind,
which strikes most fiercely on
the loftiest summits (<i>Parad.</i>
xvii. 133); and it agrees well
with such a profession, that the
first stroke he deals in the
<i>Comedy</i> is at a Pope.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_213_213" id="Footnote_213_213"></a><a href="#FNanchor_213_213"><span class="label">[213]</span></a> <i>Caitiffs</i>: To one who had
suffered like Dante for the frank
part he took in affairs, neutrality
may well have seemed the unpardonable
sin in politics; and
no doubt but that his thoughts
were set on the trimmers in
Florence when he wrote, ‘Let
us not speak of them!’</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_214_214" id="Footnote_214_214"></a><a href="#FNanchor_214_214"><span class="label">[214]</span></a> <i>A veteran</i>: Charon. In all
this description of the passage
of the river by the shades, Dante
borrows freely from Virgil. It
has been already remarked on
<i>Inf.</i> ii. 28 that he draws
illustrations from Pagan sources.
More than that, as we begin to
find, he boldly introduces legendary
and mythological characters
among the persons of his drama.
With Milton in mind, it surprises,
on a first acquaintance
with the <i>Comedy</i>, to discover
how nearly independent of angels
is the economy invented by
Dante for the other world.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_215_215" id="Footnote_215_215"></a><a href="#FNanchor_215_215"><span class="label">[215]</span></a> <i>Other ways, etc.</i>: The souls
bound from earth to Purgatory
gather at the mouth of the
Tiber, whence they are wafted
on an angel’s skiff to their
destination (<i>Purg.</i> ii. 100). It
may be here noted that never
does Dante hint a fear of one
day becoming a denizen of Inferno.
It is only the pains
of Purgatory that oppress his
soul by anticipation. So here
Charon is made to see at a
glance that the pilgrim is not
of those ‘who make descent to
Acheron.’</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_216_216" id="Footnote_216_216"></a><a href="#FNanchor_216_216"><span class="label">[216]</span></a> <i>As fowls, etc.</i>: ‘As a bird to
its lure’—generally interpreted
of the falcon when called back.
But a witness of the sport of
netting thrushes in Tuscany
describes them as ‘flying into
the vocal ambush in a hurried,
half-reluctant, and very remarkable
manner.’</p></div>

state of unconsciousness, Dante,
he knows not how, has been
conveyed across Acheron, and
is awakened by what seems like
the thunder-peal following the
lightning-flash which made him
insensible. He now stands on
the brink of Inferno, where the
sounds peculiar to each region
of it converge and are reverberated
from its rim. These sounds
are not again to be heard by him
except in their proper localities.
No sooner does he actually pass
into the First Circle than he hears
only sighs.—As regards the topography
of Inferno, it is enough,
as yet, to note that it consists of
a cavity extending from the surface
to the centre of the earth;
narrowing to its base, and with
many circular ledges or terraces,
of great width in the case of the
upper ones, running round its
wall—that is, round the sides of
the pit. Each terrace or circle
is thus less in circumference than
the one above it. From one
circle to the next there slopes a
bank of more or less height and
steepness. Down the bank
which falls to the comparatively
flat ground of the First Circle
they are now about to pass.—To
put it otherwise, the Inferno
is an inverted hollow
cone.</p></div>

some editors into <i>porta</i>; but
though baptism is technically

the other arts and sciences.’—I
quote with misgiving from Tamburini’s
untrustworthy Italian
translation. Benvenuto lectured
on the <i>Comedy</i> in Bologna
for some years about 1370. It
is greatly to be wished that his

then stand for the seven liberal

The moat may be eloquence, set
outside the castle to signify
that only as reflected in the

Circle of the Inferno, and the
first of punishment. The lower
the circle, the more rigorous the
penalty endured in it. Here is
punished carnal sin.</p></div>

King of Crete, so severely just
as to be made after death one
of the judges of the under world.
He is degraded by Dante, as
many other noble persons of the
old mythology are by him, into a
demon. Unlike the fallen angels
of Milton, Dante’s devils have
no interest of their own. Their
only function is to help in working
out human destinies.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_250_250" id="Footnote_250_250"></a><a href="#FNanchor_250_250"><span class="label">[250]</span></a> <i>Downward hurled</i>: Each
falls to his proper place without
lingering by the way. All
through Inferno there is an
absence of direct Divine interposition.
It is ruled, as it were,
by a course of nature. The sinners,
compelled by a fatal impulse,
advance to hear their
doom, just as they fall inevitably
one by one into Charon’s boat.
Minos by a sort of devilish instinct
sentences each sinner to his appropriate
punishment. In <i>Inf.</i>
xxvii. 127 we find the words
in which Minos utters his judgment.
In <i>Inf.</i> xxi. 29 a devil
bears the sinner to his own place.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_251_251" id="Footnote_251_251"></a><a href="#FNanchor_251_251"><span class="label">[251]</span></a> <i>Why also, etc.</i>: Like Charon.
If Minos represents conscience,
as some would have it, Dante is
here again assailed by misgivings
as to his enterprise, and is quieted
by reason in the person of Virgil.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_252_252" id="Footnote_252_252"></a><a href="#FNanchor_252_252"><span class="label">[252]</span></a> <i>Thus ’tis willed, etc.</i>: These
two lines are the same as those
to Charon, <i>Inf.</i> iii. 95, 96.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_253_253" id="Footnote_253_253"></a><a href="#FNanchor_253_253"><span class="label">[253]</span></a> <i>Precipitous extreme</i>: Opinions
vary as to what is meant by
<i>ruina</i>. As Dante is certainly still
on the outer edge of the Second
Circle or terrace, and while
standing there hears distinctly
the words the spirits say when
they reach the <i>ruina</i>, it most
likely denotes the steep slope falling
from the First to the Second
Circle. The spirits, driven against
the wall which hems them in,
burst into sharp lamentations
against their irremediable
fate.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_254_254" id="Footnote_254_254"></a><a href="#FNanchor_254_254"><span class="label">[254]</span></a> <i>I understood, etc.</i>: From
the nature of the punishment,
which, like all the others invented
by Dante, bears some relation
to the sin to which it is assigned.
They who on earth failed to
exercise self-restraint are beaten
hither and thither by every wind
that blows; and, as once they
were blinded by passion, so now
they see nothing plainly in that
dim and obscure place. That
Dante should assign the least
grievous punishment of all to
this sin throws light upon his
views of life. In his eyes it had
more than any other the excuse
of natural bent, and had least of
malice. Here, it must be remarked,
are no seducers. For
them a lower depth is reserved
(<i>Inf.</i> xviii. See also <i>Purg.</i> xxvii.
15).</p></div>

are a kind of bird that go in a
troop, as cavaliers go to battle,
following one another in single
file. And one of them goes
always in front as their gonfalonier,
guiding and leading them
with its voice’ (Brunetto Latini,

sinners—lovers with something

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_267_267" id="Footnote_267_267"></a><a href="#FNanchor_267_267"><span class="label">[267]</span></a> <i>Native city</i>: Ravenna. The
speaker is Francesca, daughter
of Guido of Polenta, lord of
Ravenna. About the year 1275
she was married to Gianciotto
(Deformed John) Malatesta, son
of the lord of Rimini; the marriage,
like most of that time in
the class to which she belonged,
being one of political convenience.
She allowed her affections
to settle on Paolo, her husband’s
handsome brother; and Gianciotto’s
suspicions having been
aroused, he surprised the
lovers and slew them on the
spot. This happened at Pesaro.
The association of Francesca’s
name with Rimini is merely
accidental. The date of her
death is not known. Dante can
never have set eyes on Francesca;
but at the battle of Campaldino
in 1289, where he was
present, a troop of cavaliers from
Pistoia fought on the Florentine
side under the command of her
brother Bernardino; and in the
following year, Dante being then
twenty-five years of age, her
father, Guido, was Podesta in
Florence. The Guido of Polenta,
lord of Ravenna, whom
Dante had for his last and most
generous patron, was grandson
of that elder Guido, and nephew
of Francesca.</p></div>

right and duty were
too well defined in the prevalent
social code for her
to complain that Gianciotto
avenged himself. What she
does resent is that she was left
no breathing-space for repentance
and farewells.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_269_269" id="Footnote_269_269"></a><a href="#FNanchor_269_269"><span class="label">[269]</span></a> <i>Which absolves, etc.</i>: Which
compels whoever is beloved to
love in return. Here is the
key to Dante’s comparatively
lenient estimate of the guilt of
Francesca’s sin. See line 39,
and <i>Inf.</i> xi. 83. The Church
allowed no distinctions with regard
to the lost. Dante, for his
own purposes, invents a scale of
guilt; and in settling the degrees
of it he is greatly influenced
by human feeling—sometimes
by private likes and dislikes.
The vestibule of the caitiffs,
<i>e.g.</i>, is his own creation.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_270_270" id="Footnote_270_270"></a><a href="#FNanchor_270_270"><span class="label">[270]</span></a> <i>Caïna</i>: The Division of the
Ninth and lowest Circle, assigned
to those treacherous to their
kindred (<i>Inf.</i> xxxii. 58). Her
husband was still living in 1300.—May
not the words of this line
be spoken by Paolo? It is as a
fratricide even more than as the
slayer of his wife that Gianciotto
is to find his place in Caïna.
The words are more in keeping
with the masculine than the
feminine character. They certainly
jar somewhat with the
gentler censure of line 102.
And, immediately after, Dante
speaks of what the ‘souls’ have
said.</p></div>

of Dante’s favourite authors
(<i>Convito</i> ii. 13), says in his
<i>De Consol. Phil.</i>, ‘The greatest
misery in adverse fortune is
once to have been happy.’ But,
granting that Dante found the
idea in Boethius, it is clearly
Virgil that Francesca means.
She sees that Dante’s guide is
a shade, and gathers from his
grave passionless aspect that he
is one condemned for ever to
look back with futile regret upon
his happier past.</p></div>

them. Her smile, or laugh, as
she ‘took Lancelot by the chin

lover of his conquest. The
Arthurian Romances were the

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_282_282" id="Footnote_282_282"></a><a href="#FNanchor_282_282"><span class="label">[282]</span></a> <i>After, etc.</i>: In the following
nine lines the party history
of Florence for two years after
the period of the poem (March
1300) is roughly indicated.
The city was divided into two
factions—the Whites, led by the
great merchant Vieri dei Cerchi,
and the Blacks, led by Corso
Donati, a poor and turbulent
noble. At the close of 1300
there was a bloody encounter
between the more violent members
of the two parties. In
May 1301 the Blacks were
banished. In the autumn of
that year they returned in triumph
to the city in the train of
Charles of Valois, and got the
Whites banished in April 1302,
within three years, that is, of the
poet’s talk with Ciacco. Dante
himself was associated with the
Whites, but not as a violent
partisan; for though he was a
strong politician no party quite
answered his views. From the
middle of June till the middle of
August 1300 he was one of the
Priors. In the course of 1301
he is believed to have gone
on an embassy to Rome to persuade
the Pope to abstain from
meddling in Florentine affairs.
He never entered Florence
again, being condemned virtually
to banishment in January
1302.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_283_283" id="Footnote_283_283"></a><a href="#FNanchor_283_283"><span class="label">[283]</span></a> <i>The boorish party</i>: <i>la parte
selvaggia</i>. The Whites; but
what is exactly meant by <i>selvaggia</i>
is not clear. Literally it
is ‘woodland,’ and some say it
refers to the Cerchi having originally
come from a well-wooded
district; which is absurd. Nor,
taking the word in its secondary
meaning of savage, does it apply
better to one party than another—not
so well, perhaps, to the
Whites as to the Blacks. Villani
also terms the Cerchi <i>salvatichi</i>
(viii. 39), and in a connection
where it may mean rude, ill-mannered.
I take it that Dante
here indulges in a gibe at the
party to which he once belonged,
but which, ere he began the
<i>Comedy</i>, he had quite broken
with. In <i>Parad.</i> xvii. 62 he
terms the members of it ‘wicked
and stupid.’ The sneer in the
text would come well enough
from the witty and soft-living
Ciacco.</p></div>

unknown. He thus distinctly
puts from himself any
blame for the evil turn things
had taken in Florence. How
thoroughly he had broken with
his party ere he wrote this is
proved by his exclusion of the
irresolute but respectable Vieri
dei Cerchi from the number of
the just men. He, in Dante’s
judgment, was only too much
listened to.—It will be borne in
mind that, at the time assigned
to the action of the <i>Comedy</i>,
Dante was still resident in
Florence.</p></div>

Inferno many such prayers are
addressed to Dante. The shades
in Purgatory ask to have their
friends on earth stirred to offer
up petitions for their speedy
purification and deliverance;
but the only alleviation possible
for the doomed spirits is to know
that they are not yet forgotten up
in the ‘sweet world.’ A double
artistic purpose is served by
representing them as feeling
thus. It relieves the mind to
think that in such misery there
is any source of comfort at all.
And by making them be still interested
on their own account in
the thoughts of men, the eager
colloquies in which they engage
with Dante on such unequal
terms gain in verisimilitude.</p></div>

Circle is divided half-way round
between the misers and spendthrifts,
and the two bands at set
periods clash against one another
in their vain effort to pass into
the section belonging to the
opposite party. Their condition
is emblematical of their sins
while in life. They were one-sided
in their use of wealth; so
here they can never complete the
circle. The monotony of their
employment and of their cries
represents their subjection to one
idea, and, as in life, so now,
their displeasure is excited by
nothing so much as by coming
into contact with the failing
opposite to their own. Yet they
are set in the same circle because
the sin of both arose from inordinate desire of wealth, the
miser craving it to hoard, and
the spendthrift to spend. In
Purgatory also they are placed together
(see <i>Purg.</i> xxii. 40). So,
on Dante’s scheme, liberality is
allied to and dependent on a
wise and reasonable frugality.—There
is no hint of the enormous
length of the course run by these
shades. Far lower down, when
the circles of the Inferno have
greatly narrowed, the circuit is
twenty-two miles (<i>Inf.</i> xxix. 9).</p></div>

faces of miser and spendthrift
fell, while their eyes travelled
vaguely beyond him, and their
voices grew cold.</p></div>

of Fortune as if she were a brutal
and somewhat malicious power.
In Virgil’s answer there is a refutation
of the opinion of Fortune
given by Dante himself, in the
<i>Convito</i> (iv. 11). After describing
three ways in which the goods
of Fortune come to men he says:
‘In each of these three ways her
injustice is manifest.’ This part
of the <i>Convito</i> Fraticelli seems
almost to prove was written in
1297.</p></div>

to the scholastic theory of the
world, each of the nine heavens
was directed in its motion by
intelligences, called angels by
the vulgar, and by the heathen,
gods (<i>Convito</i> ii. 5). As these
spheres and the influences they
exercise on human affairs are
under the guidance of divinely-appointed ministers, so, Virgil
says, is the distribution of
worldly wealth ruled by Providence
through Fortune.</p></div>

long believed, nor is the belief
quite obsolete, that one community
can gain only at the expense
of another. Sir Thomas Browne
says: ‘All cannot be happy at
once; for because the glory of
one state depends upon the ruin
of another, there is a revolution
and vicissitude of their greatness,
and all must obey the swing of
that wheel, not moved by intelligences,
but by the hand of God,
whereby all states arise to their
zeniths and vertical points according
to their predestinated
periods.’—<i>Rel. Med.</i> i. 17.</p></div>

perhaps, by Horace’s <i>Te semper
anteit sæva necessitas</i> (<i>Od.</i> i.
35). The question of how men
can be free in the face of necessity,
here associated with Fortune,
more than once emerges
in the <i>Comedy</i>. Dante’s belief
on the subject was substantially
that of his favourite author
Boethius, who holds that ultimately
‘it is Providence that
turns the wheel of all things;’
and who says, that ‘if you spread
your sails to the wind you will
be carried, not where you would,
but whither you are driven by
the gale: if you choose to commit
yourself to Fortune, you
must endure the manners of your
mistress.’</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_311_311" id="Footnote_311_311"></a><a href="#FNanchor_311_311"><span class="label">[311]</span></a> <i>In gloom</i>: These submerged
spirits are, according to the older
commentators, the slothful—those
guilty of the sin of slackness
in the pursuit of good, as,
<i>e.g.</i> neglect of the means of
grace. This is, theologically
speaking, the sin directly opposed
to the active grace of
charity. By more modern critics
it has been ingeniously sought
to find in this circle a place not
only for the slothful but for the
proud and envious as well. To
each of these classes of sinners—such
of them as have repented
in this life—a terrace of Purgatory
is assigned, and at first sight
it does seem natural to expect
that the impenitent among them
should be found in Inferno.
But, while in Purgatory souls
purge themselves of every kind
of mortal sin, Inferno, as Dante
conceived of it, contains only
such sinners as have been guilty
of wicked acts. Drift and bent
of heart and mind are taken no
account of. The evil seed must
have borne a harvest, and the
guilt of every victim of Justice
must be plain and open. Now,
pride and envy are sins indeed,
but sins that a man may keep to
himself. If they have betrayed
the subject of them into the
commission of crimes, in those
crimes they are punished lower
down, as is indicated at xii. 49.
And so we find that Lucifer is condemned
as a traitor, though his
treachery sprang from envy: the
greater guilt includes the less.
For sluggishness in the pursuit of
good the vestibule of the caitiffs
seems the appropriate place.—There
are two kinds of wrath.
One is vehement, and declares
itself in violent acts; the other
does not blaze out, but is grudging
and adverse to all social
good—the wrath that is nursed.
One as much as the other affects
behaviour. So in this circle,
as in the preceding, we have
represented the two excesses
of one sin.—Dante’s theory
of sins is ably treated of in
Witte’s <i>Dante-Forschungen</i>, vol.
ii. p. 121.</p></div>

Boccaccio’s story of how the
first seven Cantos were found
among a heap of other papers,
years after Dante’s exile began;
and that ‘continuing’ marks the
resumption of his work. The
word most probably suggested
the invention of the incident,
or at least led to the identification
of some manuscript that
may have been sent to Dante,
with the opening pages of the

not only must Ciacco’s prophecy
(<i>Inf.</i> vi.) have been interpolated,
but we should be obliged to
hold that Dante began the poem
while he was a prosperous citizen.—Boccaccio
himself in his

gentleman related to the
great family of the Adimari,
and a contemporary of Dante’s.
Boccaccio in his commentary
describes him as a cavalier, very
rich, and so ostentatious that he
once shod his horse with silver,
whence his surname. In the
<i>Decameron</i> (ix. 8) he is introduced
as violently assaulting—tearing
out his hair and dragging
him in the mire—the victim
of a practical joke played by the
Ciacco of Canto vi. Some, without
reason, suppose that Dante
shows such severity to him because
he was a Black, and so a
political opponent of his own.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_323_323" id="Footnote_323_323"></a><a href="#FNanchor_323_323"><span class="label">[323]</span></a> <i>Burghers</i>: The city of Dis
composes the Sixth Circle, and,
as immediately appears, is populated
by demons. The sinners
punished in it are not mentioned
at all in this Canto, and it
seems more reasonable to apply
<i>burghers</i> to the demons than to
the shades. They are called
<i>gravi</i>, generally taken to mean
sore burdened, and the description
is then applicable to the
shades; but <i>grave</i> also bears
the sense of cruel, and may
describe the fierceness of the
devils. Though the city is inhabited
by the subjects of Dis,
he is found as Lucifer at the
very bottom of the pit. By
some critics the whole of the
lower Inferno, all that lies beyond
this point, is regarded as
being the city of Dis. But it is
the Sixth Circle, with its minarets,
that is the city; its walls,
however, serving as bulwarks
for all the lower Inferno. The
shape of the city is, of course,
that of a circular belt. Here it
may be noted that the Fifth and
Sixth Circles are on the same
level; the water of Styx, which
as a marsh covers the Fifth, is
gathered into a moat to surround
the walls of the Sixth.</p></div>

verses:’ That the verses are
called strange, as Boccaccio and
others of the older commentators
say, because treating of such a
subject in the vulgar tongue for
the first time, and in rhyme, is
difficult to believe. Rather they
are strange because of the meaning
they convey. What that is,
Dante warns the reader of
superior intellect to pause and
consider. It has been noted
(<i>Inf.</i> ii. 28) how he uses the
characters of the old mythology
as if believing in their real existence.
But this is for his
poetical ends. Here he bids
us look below the surface and
seek for the truth hidden under
the strange disguise.—The opposition
to their progress offered
by the powers of Hell perplexes
even Virgil, while Dante is reduced
to a state of absolute
terror, and is afflicted with still
sharper misgivings than he had
at the first as to the issue of
his adventure. By an indirect
question he seeks to learn how
much Virgil really knows of the
economy of the lower world;
but he cannot so much as listen
to all of his Master’s reassuring
answer, terrified as he is by the
sudden appearance of the Furies
upon the tower, which rises out
of the city of unbelief. These
symbolise the trouble of his
conscience, and, assailing him
with threats, shake his already
trembling faith in the Divine
government. How, in the face
of such foes, is he to find the
peace and liberty of soul of
which he is in search? That
this is the city of unbelief he
has not yet been told, and without
knowing it he is standing
under the very walls of Doubting
Castle. And now, if he chance
to let his eyes rest on the Gorgon’s
head, his soul will be
petrified by despair; like the
denizens of Hell, he will lose the
‘good of the intellect,’ and will
pass into a state from which Virgil—or
reason—will be powerless
to deliver him. But Virgil
takes him in time, and makes
him avert his eyes; which may
signify that the only safe course
for men is to turn their backs on
the deep and insoluble problem
of how the reality of the Divine
government can be reconciled
with the apparent triumph of
evil.</p></div>

comes from Heaven, and
his words are holy. Against the
obvious interpretation, that he is
a good angel, there lies the
objection that no other such is
met with in Inferno, and also
that it is spoken of as a new
sight for him when Dante first
meets with one in Purgatory.
But the obstruction now to be
overcome is worthy of angelic
interference; and Dante can
hardly be said to meet the
messenger, who does not even
glance in his direction. The
commentators have made this
angel mean all kind of outlandish
things.</p></div>

in Inferno that Dante is to hold
converse with celestial intelligences.
The angel, like Beatrice

across the circles, and down from
one to the other, their course is
usually to the left hand. Here
for some reason Virgil turns to
the right, so as to have the
tombs on the left as he advances.
It may be that a special proof of
his knowledge of the locality is
introduced when most needed—after
the repulse by the demons—to
strengthen Dante’s confidence
in him as a guide; or, as
some subtly think, they being
now about to enter the abode
of heresy, the movement to the
right signifies the importance of
the first step in forming opinion.
The only other occasion on which
their course is taken to the right
hand is at <i>Inf.</i> xvii. 31.</p></div>

Florentine family of the Uberti,
and, in the generation before
Dante, leader of the Ghibeline
or Imperialist party in Florence.
His memory long survived
among his fellow-townsmen as
that of the typical noble, rough-mannered,
unscrupulous, and
arrogant; but yet, for one good
action that he did, he at the
same time ranked in the popular
estimation as a patriot and a
hero. Boccaccio, misled perhaps
by the mention of Epicurus,
says that he loved rich and delicate fare. It is because all his
thoughts were worldly that he
is condemned to the city of unbelief.
Dante has already (<i>Inf.</i>

tells he is of the Alighieri, a

some slight displeasure. Or,
as a modern Florentine critic

think a moment before he can
remember on which side the
Alighieri ranged themselves—they
being of the small gentry,
while he was a great noble,

to have been more free from

in the tomb is Cavalcante
Cavalcanti, who, although
a Guelf, was tainted with the
more specially Ghibeline error
of Epicureanism. When in
order to allay party rancour
some of the Guelf and Ghibeline
families were forced to intermarry,
his son Guido took a
daughter of Farinata’s to wife.
This was in 1267, so that Guido
was much older than Dante.
Yet they were very intimate,
and, intellectually, had much in
common. With him Dante exchanged
poems of occasion, and
he terms him more than once in
the <i>Vita Nuova</i> his chief friend.
The disdain of Virgil need not
mean more than is on the surface.
Guido died in 1301. He
is the hero of the <i>Decameron</i>,

the moon. Ere fifty months
from March 1300 were past,
Dante was to see the failure of
more than one attempt made by

to gain entrance to Florence.
The great attempt was in the
beginning of 1304.</p></div>

were always specially excluded

mention of the political execution
of at least one descendant
of Farinata’s. His son when
being led to the scaffold said,
‘So we pay our fathers’ debts!’—It
has been so long common
to describe Dante as a Ghibeline,
though no careful writer does it
now, that it may be worth while
here to remark that Ghibelinism,
as Farinata understood it, was
practically extinct in Florence
ere Dante entered political life.</p></div>

exile, under Farinata; the Sienese
and Tuscan Ghibelines in general;
and some hundreds of men-at-arms
lent by Manfred. Notwithstanding
the gallant behaviour
of the Florentine burghers, the
Guelf defeat was overwhelming,
and not only did the Arbia run
red with Florentine blood—in a

ruined for a time the

time after the victory of Montaperti
there was a great Ghibeline
gathering from various cities
at Empoli, when it was proposed,
with general approval, to level
Florence with the ground in revenge
for the obstinate Guelfism
of the population. Farinata
roughly declared that as long as
he lived and had a sword he
would defend his native place,
and in the face of this protest the
resolution was departed from.
It is difficult to understand how
of all the Florentine nobles,
whose wealth consisted largely
in house property, Farinata
should have stood alone in protesting
against the ruin of the
city. But so it seems to have
been; and in this great passage
Farinata is repaid for his service,
in despite of Inferno.</p></div>

vi., prophesied what was to
happen in Florence, and Farinata
has just told him that four years
later than now he will have failed
in an attempt to return from
exile: yet Farinata does not
know if his family is still being
persecuted, and Cavalcanti fears
that his son Guido is already numbered
with the dead. Farinata
replies that like the longsighted
the shades can only see what is
some distance off, and are ignorant
of what is going on, or about
to happen; which seems to imply
that they forget what they
once foresaw. Guido was to die
within a few months, and the
event was too close at hand to
come within the range of his
father’s vision.</p></div>

Below them lie the circles filled
with such as have been guilty

violence or by fraud. After first
mentioning in a general way
that the fraudulent are set lowest
in Inferno, Virgil proceeds to
define violence, and to tell how
the violent occupy the circle
immediately beneath them—the
Seventh. For division of the
maliciously wicked into two
classes Dante is supposed to be
indebted to Cicero: ‘Injury
may be wrought by force or by
fraud.... Both are unnatural for
man, but fraud is the more
hateful.’—<i>De Officiis</i>,

sin from the lavish spending
punished in the Fourth Circle
(<i>Inf.</i> vii.). The distinction is that
between thriftlessness and the
prodigality which, stripping a
man of the means of living, disgusts
him with life, as described
in the following line. It is from
among prodigals that the ranks
of suicides are greatly filled, and
here they are appropriately
placed together. It may seem
strange that in his classification
of guilt Dante should rank
violence to one’s self as a more
heinous sin than that committed
against one’s neighbour. He
may have in view the fact that
none harm their neighbours so
much as they who are oblivious
of their own true interest.</p></div>

of Aristotle, in which it is said:
‘With regard to manners, these
three things are to be eschewed:
incontinence, vice, and bestiality.’
Aristotle holds incontinence
to consist in the immoderate
indulgence of propensities which
under right guidance are adapted
to promote lawful pleasure. It
is, generally speaking, the sin of
which those about whom Dante
has inquired were guilty.—It
has been ingeniously sought by
Philalethes (<i>Gött. Com.</i>) to show
that Virgil’s disquisition is
founded on this threefold classification
of Aristotle’s—violence
being taken to be the same as
bestiality, and malice as vice.
But the reference to Aristotle
is made with the limited purpose
of justifying the lenient
treatment of incontinence; in
the same way as a few lines
further on Genesis is referred
to in support of the harsh
treatment of usury.</p></div>

to harmonise the astronomical
indications scattered throughout
the <i>Comedy</i>, there being traces
of Dante’s having sometimes
used details belonging rather to
the day on which Good Friday
fell in 1300, the 8th of April,
than to the (supposed) true
anniversary of the crucifixion.
That this, the 25th of March, is
the day he intended to conform
to appears from <i>Inf.</i> xxi. 112.—The
time is now near dawn
on the Saturday morning. It is
almost needless to say that
Virgil speaks of the stars as he
knows they are placed, but
without seeing them. By what
light they see in Inferno is nowhere
explained. We have
been told that it was dark as
night (<i>Inf.</i> iv. 10, v. 28).</p></div>

Ghibeline of his time. He was

was Imperial Vicar of the Trevisian
Mark. Towards the close
of Fredrick’s life, and for some
years after, he exercised almost
independent power in Vicenza,
Padua, and Verona. Cruelty,
erected into a system, was his
chief instrument of government,
and ‘in his dungeons men found
something worse than death.’
For Italians, says Burckhardt, he
was the most impressive political
personage of the thirteenth century;
and around his memory, as
around Frederick’s, there gathered
strange legends. He died
in 1259, of a wound received in
battle. When urged to confess
his sins by the monk who came
to shrive him, he declared that
the only sin on his conscience
was negligence in revenge. But
this may be mythical, as may also
be the long black hair between
his eyebrows, which rose up stiff
and terrible as his anger waxed.</p></div>

believed, by a son, here called
a stepson for his unnatural conduct.

son of Richard of Cornwall and
cousin of Edward I. of England.
The motive of the murder was
to revenge the death of his
father, Simon, at Evesham.
The body of the young prince
was conveyed to England, and
the heart was placed in a vase

The shade of Guy stands up to

is a town on the coast of what

Dante thus indirectly acknowledges
his debt to Virgil; and,
perhaps, at the same time puts
in his claim to an imaginative
licence equal to that taken by
his master. On a modern
reader the effect of the reference
is to weaken the verisimilitude
of the incident.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_423_423" id="Footnote_423_423"></a><a href="#FNanchor_423_423"><span class="label">[423]</span></a> <i>For I am he, etc.</i>: The
speaker is Pier delle Vigne,
who from being a begging
student of Bologna rose to be
the Chancellor of the Emperor
Frederick <span class="smcap">II.</span>, the chief councillor
of that monarch, and one
of the brightest ornaments of
his intellectual court. Peter
was perhaps the more endeared
to his master because, like him,
he was a poet of no mean order.
There are two accounts of what
caused his disgrace. According
to one of these he was found to
have betrayed Frederick’s interests
in favour of the Pope’s;
and according to the other he
tried to poison him. Neither is
it known whether he committed
suicide; though he is said to
have done so after being disgraced,
by dashing his brains
out against a church wall in
Pisa. Dante clearly follows
this legend. The whole episode
is eloquent of the esteem in
which Peter’s memory was held
by Dante. His name is not
mentioned in Inferno, but yet
the promise is amply kept that
it shall flourish on earth again,
freed from unmerited disgrace.
He died about 1249.</p></div>

Virgil never asks a question for
his own satisfaction. He knows
who the spirits are, what brought
them there, and which of them
will speak honestly out on the
promise of having his fame refreshed
in the world. It should
be noted how, by a hint, he
has made Peter aware of who
he is (line 48); a delicate attention yielded to no other
shade in the Inferno, except
Ulysses (<i>Inf.</i> xxvi. 79), and,
perhaps, Brunetto Latini (<i>Inf.</i>
xv. 99).</p></div>

tradition the original patron of
Florence was Mars. In Dante’s
time an ancient statue, supposed
to be of that god, stood upon
the Old Bridge of Florence. It
is referred to in <i>Parad.</i> xvi. 47
and 145. Benvenuto says that
he had heard from Boccaccio,
who had frequently heard it from
old people, that the statue was
regarded with great awe. If a
boy flung stones or mud at it,
the bystanders would say of him
that he would make a bad end.
It was lost in the great flood of
1333. Here the Florentine shade
represents Mars as troubling
Florence with wars in revenge
for being cast off as a patron.</p></div>

settled who this was who hanged
himself from the beams of his

some; others, one of the Mozzi.
Boccaccio and Peter Dante
remark that suicide by hanging
was common in Florence. But
Dante’s text seems pretty often
to have suggested the invention
of details in support or illustration
of it.</p></div>

of Alexander to Aristotle, in

hindrances met with by his

showers of fire. But in that

trampled down, while the flakes
of fire are caught by the soldiers
upon their outspread cloaks.
The story of the shower of fire
may have been suggested by
Plutarch’s mention of the mineral
oil in the province of Babylon,
a strange thing to the
Greeks; and of how they were
entertained by seeing the ground,
which had been sprinkled with
it, burst into flame.</p></div>

untouched by the pain he affects
to despise, he would yet suffer
enough from the mad hatred of
God that rages in his breast.
Capaneus is the nearest approach
to the Satan of Milton found in
the <i>Inferno</i>. From the need of
getting law enough by which to
try the heathen Dante is led
into some inconsistency. After
condemning the virtuous heathen
to Limbo for their ignorance of
the one true God, he now condemns
the wicked heathen to
this circle for despising false
gods. Jupiter here stands for,
as need scarcely be said, the
Supreme Ruler; and in that
sense he is termed God (line 69).
But it remains remarkable that
the one instance of blasphemous
defiance of God should be taken
from classical fable.</p></div>

spring a couple of miles from
Viterbo, greatly frequented for
baths in the Middle Ages; and,
it is said, especially by light
women. The water boils up
into a large pool, whence it
flows by narrow channels; sometimes
by one and sometimes by
another, as the purposes of the
neighbouring peasants require.
Sulphurous fumes rise from the
water as it runs. The incrustation
of the bottom, sides, and edges
of those channels gives them the
air of being solidly built.</p></div>

of the canal there is a flat pathway
of solid stone; and Dante
sees that only by following one
of these can a passage be gained
across the desert, for to set foot
on the sand is impossible for
him owing to the falling flakes
of fire. There may be found in
his description of the solid and
flawless masonry of the canal a
trace of the pleasure taken in
good building by the contemporaries
of Arnolfo. Nor is it
without meaning that the sterile
sands, the abode of such as despised
honest labour, is crossed
by a perfect work of art which
they are forbidden ever to set
foot upon.</p></div>

of this image is taken from the
figure in Nebuchadnezzar’s
dream in Daniel ii. But here,
instead of the Four Empires,
the materials of the statue represent
the Four Ages of the
world; the foot of clay on
which it stands being the present
time, which is so bad that
even iron were too good to represent
it. Time turns his back
to the outworn civilisations of
the East, and his face to Rome,
which, as the seat of the Empire
and the Church, holds the secret
of the future. The tears of
time shed by every Age save
that of Gold feed the four infernal
streams and pools of
Acheron, Styx, Phlegethon, and
Cocytus. Line 117 indicates that
these are all fed by the same
water; are in fact different
names for the same flood of tears.
The reason why Dante has not
hitherto observed the connection
between them is that he has not
made a complete circuit of each
or indeed of any circle, as Virgil
reminds him at line 124, etc.
The rivulet by which they stand
drains the boiling Phlegethon—where
the water is all changed
to blood, because in it the
murderers are punished—and
flowing through the forest of the
suicides and the desert of the
blasphemers, etc., tumbles into
the Eighth Circle as described in
Canto xvi. 103. Cocytus they
are afterward to reach. An
objection to this account of the
infernal rivers as being all fed by
the same waters may be found
in the difference of volume of the
great river of Acheron (<i>Inf.</i> iii.
71) and of this brooklet. But
this difference is perhaps to be
explained by the evaporation
from the boiling waters of
Phlegethon and of this stream
which drains it. Dante is
almost the only poet applied to
whom such criticism would not
be trifling. Another difficult
point is how Cocytus should not
in time have filled, and more
than filled, the Ninth Circle.</p></div>

has been much disputed. It can
be taken for Carinthia only on
the supposition that Dante was

but it may be a question
how old that name is. The district

limitation is very characteristic of
Dante’s style of thought, which

my face bent to his’ is another
reading, but there seems to be
most authority for that in the
text.—The fiery shower forbids
Dante to stoop over the edge

who is some feet below him, he
throws out his open hand, a
gesture of astonishment mingled
with pity.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_460_460" id="Footnote_460_460"></a><a href="#FNanchor_460_460"><span class="label">[460]</span></a> <i>Ser Brunetto</i>: Brunetto
Latini, a Florentine, was born
in 1220. As a notary he was
entitled to be called Ser, or
Messer. As appears from the
context, Dante was under great
intellectual obligations to him,
not, we may suppose, as to a tutor
so much as to an active-minded
and scholarly friend of mature
age, and possessed of a ripe experience
of affairs. The social
respect that Dante owed him is
indicated by the use of the plural
form of address. See note, <i>Inf.</i>
x. 51. Brunetto held high appointments
in the Republic.
Perhaps with some exaggeration,
Villani says of him that he was
the first to refine the Florentines,
teaching them to speak correctly,
and to administer State affairs
on fixed principles of politics
(<i>Cronica</i>, viii. 10). A Guelf in
politics, he shared in the exile
of his party after the Ghibeline
victory of Montaperti in 1260,
and for some years resided in
Paris. There is reason to suppose
that he returned to Florence
in 1269, and that he acted
as prothonotary of the court of
Charles of Valois’ vicar-general
in Tuscany. His signature as
secretary to the Council of
Florence is found under the
date of 1273. He died in 1294,
when Dante was twenty-nine,
and was buried in the cloister of
Santa Maria Maggiore, where
his tombstone may still be
seen. (Not in Santa Maria
Novella.) Villani mentions him
in his Chronicle with some
reluctance, seeing he was a
‘worldly man.’ His life must
indeed have been vicious to
the last, before Dante could
have had the heart to fix him
in such company. Brunetto’s
chief works are the <i>Tesoro</i> and
<i>Tesoretto</i>. For the <i>Tesoro</i>, see
note at line 119. The <i>Tesoretto</i>,
or <i>Little Treasure</i>, is an allegorical
poem in Italian rhymed couplets.
In it he imagines himself,
as he is on his return from an
embassy to Alphonso of Castile,
meeting a scholar of Bologna of
whom he asks ‘in smooth sweet
words for news of Tuscany.’
Having been told of the catastrophe
of Montaperti he wanders
out of the beaten way into
the Forest of Roncesvalles,
where he meets with various
experiences; he is helped by
Ovid, is instructed by Ptolemy,
and grows penitent for his sins.
In this, it will be seen, there is a
general resemblance to the action
of the <i>Comedy</i>. There are even
turns of expression that recall
Dante (<i>e.g.</i> beginning of <i>Cap.</i> iv.);
but all together amounts to little.</p></div>

not projecting it beyond the line
of safety, strictly defined by the
edge of the causeway. We
are to imagine to ourselves the
fire of Sodom falling on Brunetto’s
upturned face, and missing
Dante’s head only by an
inch.</p></div>

has asked who the guide is, and
Dante does not tell him. A
reason for the refusal has been
ingeniously found in the fact
that among the numerous citations
of the <i>Treasure</i> Brunetto
seldom quotes Virgil. See also
the charge brought against Guido
Cavalcanti (<i>Inf.</i> x. 63), of holding
Virgil in disdain. But it is
explanation enough of Dante’s
omission to name his guide that
he is passing through Inferno to
gain experience for himself, and
not to satisfy the curiosity of the
shades he meets. See note on
line 99.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_464_464" id="Footnote_464_464"></a><a href="#FNanchor_464_464"><span class="label">[464]</span></a> <i>Thy planet’s light</i>: Some
think that Brunetto had cast
Dante’s horoscope. In a remarkable
passage (<i>Parad.</i> xxii.
112) Dante attributes any genius
he may have to the influence of
the Twins, which constellation
was in the ascendant when he
was born. See also <i>Inf.</i> xxvi.
23. But here it is more likely
that Brunetto refers to his observation
of Dante’s good qualities,
from which he gathered
that he was well starred.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_465_465" id="Footnote_465_465"></a><a href="#FNanchor_465_465"><span class="label">[465]</span></a> <i>Fiesole</i>: The mother city of
Florence, to which also most of
the Fiesolans were believed to
have migrated at the beginning
of the eleventh century. But
all the Florentines did their
best to establish a Roman descent
for themselves; and Dante
among them. His fellow-citizens
he held to be for the most
part of the boorish Fiesolan
breed, rude and stony-hearted
as the mountain in whose cleft
the cradle of their race was seen
from Florence.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_466_466" id="Footnote_466_466"></a><a href="#FNanchor_466_466"><span class="label">[466]</span></a> <i>Both sides</i>: This passage
was most likely written not long
after Dante had ceased to entertain
any hope of winning his
way back to Florence in the
company of the Whites, whose
exile he shared, and when he
was already standing in proud
isolation from Black and White,
from Guelf and Ghibeline.
There is nothing to show that
his expectation of being courted
by both sides ever came true.
Never a strong partisan, he had,
to use his own words, at last to
make a party by himself, and
stood out an Imperialist with
his heart set on the triumph of
an Empire far nobler than that
the Ghibeline desired. Dante
may have hoped to hold a place
of honour some day in the council
of a righteous Emperor; and
this may be the glorious haven
with the dream of which he was
consoled in the wanderings of
his exile.</p></div>

interpretations of this somewhat
obscure sentence that seems the
best which applies it to Virgil’s
<i>Quicquid erit, superanda omnis
fortuna ferendo est</i>—‘Whatever
shall happen, every fate is to be
vanquished by endurance’ (<i>Æn.</i>
v. 710). Taking this way of it,
we have in the form of Dante’s
profession of indifference to all
the adverse fortune that may be
in store for him a refined
compliment to his Guide; and
in Virgil’s gesture and words an
equally delicate revelation of
himself to Brunetto, in which is
conveyed an answer to the
question at line 48, ‘Who is
this that shows the way?’—Otherwise,
the words convey
Virgil’s approbation of Dante’s
having so well attended to his advice
to store Farinata’s prophecy
in his memory (<i>Inf.</i> x.127).</p></div>

of the Pope’s titles is <i>Servus
Servorum Domini</i>. The application
of it to Boniface, so hated
by Dante, may be ironical:
‘Fit servant of such a slave to
vice!’ The priest referred to
so contemptuously is Andrea,
of the great Florentine family of
the Mozzi, who was much engaged
in the political affairs of
his time, and became Bishop of
Florence in 1286. About ten
years later he was translated to
Vicenza, which stands on the
Bacchiglione; and he died
shortly afterwards. According
to Benvenuto he was a ridiculous
preacher and a man of
dissolute manners. What is
now most interesting about him
is that he was Dante’s chief
pastor during his early manhood,
and is consigned by him to the
same disgraceful circle of Inferno
as his beloved master
Brunetto Latini—a terrible evidence
of the corruption of life
among the churchmen as well
as the scholars of the thirteenth
century.</p></div>

was written by him in French as
being ‘the pleasantest language,
and the most widely spread.’
In it he treats of things in general
in the encyclopedic fashion
set him by Alphonso of Castile.
The first half consists of a summary
of civil and natural history.
The second is devoted to ethics,
rhetoric, and politics. To a
great extent it is a compilation,
containing, for instance, a translation,
nearly complete, of the
Ethics of Aristotle—not, of
course, direct from the Greek.
It is written in a plodding style,
and speaks to more industry
than genius. To it Dante is
indebted for some facts and
fables.</p></div>

a victory won by the
Veronese there was instituted
a race to be run on the first
Sunday of Lent. The prize
was a piece of green cloth. The
competitors ran naked.—Brunetto
does not disappear into the
gloom without a parting word
of applause from his old pupil.
Dante’s rigorous sentence on
his beloved master is pronounced
as softly as it can be. We must
still wonder that he has the
heart to bring him to such an
awful judgment.</p></div>

have little to tell of him except
that he made an unhappy marriage,

known beyond what is to be
inferred from the poet’s words,
and nothing to say, except that
when Dante consigned men of
their stamp, frank and amiable,
to the Infernal Circles, we may
be sure that he only executed a
verdict already accepted as just
by the whole of Florence. And
when we find him impartially
damning Guelf and Ghibeline
we may be equally sure that he
looked for the aid of neither
party, and of no family however
powerful in the State, to bring
his banishment to a close. He
would even seem to be careful
to stop any hole by which he
might creep back to Florence.
When he did return, it was to
be in the train of the Emperor, so
he hoped, and as one who gives
rather than seeks forgiveness.</p></div>

witty and well bred,
according to Boccaccio. Being
once at Genoa he was shown a
fine new palace by its miserly
owner, and was asked to suggest
a subject for a painting
with which to adorn the hall.
The subject was to be something
that nobody had ever
seen. Borsiere proposed liberality
as something that the miser
at any rate had never yet got a
good sight of; an answer of
which it is not easy to detect
either the wit or the courtesy,
but which is said to have converted
the churl to liberal ways
(<i>Decam.</i> i. 8). He is here introduced
as an authority on the
noble style of manners.</p></div>

that leads to great actions, and
the gentle manners that prevail
in a society where there is a due
subordination of rank to rank

noble sense, was Dante’s ideal
of a social state; for all his
instincts were those of a Florentine
aristocrat, corrected though
they were by his good sense and
his thirst for a reign of perfect
justice. During his own
time he had seen Florence grow
more and more democratic; and
he was irritated—unreasonably,
considering that it was only a
sign of the general prosperity—at
the spectacle of the amazing
growth of wealth in the hands
of low-born traders, who every
year were coming more to the
front and monopolising influence
at home and abroad at the
cost of their neighbours and
rivals with longer pedigrees and
shorter purses. In <i>Paradiso</i>
xvi. Dante dwells at length on
the degeneracy of the Florentines.</p></div>

water of the brook over the lofty
cliff that sinks from the Seventh
to the Eighth Circle is compared
to the waterfall upon the Montone
at the monastery of St.
Benedict, in the mountains

Monte Viso. Dante here
travels in imagination from
Monte Viso down through Italy,
and finds that all the rivers
which rise on the left hand, that
is, on the north-east of the
Apennine, fall into the Po, till
the Montone is reached, that
river falling into the Adriatic by
a course of its own. Above
Forlì it was called Acquacheta.
The Lamone, north of the Montone,
now follows an independent
course to the sea, having cut
a new bed for itself since Dante’s
time.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_494_494" id="Footnote_494_494"></a><a href="#FNanchor_494_494"><span class="label">[494]</span></a> <i>The cord</i>: The services of
Geryon are wanted to convey
them down the next reach of the
pit; and as no voice could be
heard for the noise of the waterfall,
and no signal be made to
catch the eye amid the gloom,
Virgil is obliged to call the
attention of the monster by casting
some object into the depth
where he lies concealed. But,
since they are surrounded by
solid masonry and slack sand,
one or other of them must supply
something fit to throw down;
and the cord worn by Dante is
fixed on as what can best be
done without. There may be a
reference to the cord of Saint
Francis, which Dante, according
to one of his commentators,
wore when he was a young man,
following in this a fashion common
enough among pious laymen
who had no thought of
ever becoming friars. But the
simile of the cord, as representing
sobriety and virtuous purpose,
is not strange to Dante. In
<i>Purg.</i> vii. 114 he describes
Pedro of Arragon as being girt
with the cord of every virtue;
and Pedro was no Franciscan.
Dante’s cord may therefore be
taken as standing for vigilance
or self-control. With it he had
hoped to get the better of the
leopard (<i>Inf.</i> i. 32), and may
have trusted in it for support as
against the terrors of Inferno.
But although he has been girt
with it ever since he entered by
the gate, it has not saved him
from a single fear, far less from a
single danger; and now it is cast
away as useless. Henceforth,
more than ever, he is to confide
wholly in Virgil and have no
confidence in himself. Nor is
he to be girt again till he reaches
the coast of Purgatory, and then
it is to be with a reed, the
emblem of humility.—But, however
explained, the incident
will always be somewhat of a
puzzle.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_495_495" id="Footnote_495_495"></a><a href="#FNanchor_495_495"><span class="label">[495]</span></a> Dante attributes to Virgil
full knowledge of all that is in
his own mind. He thus heightens
our conception of his dependence
on his guide, with
whose will his will is blent, and
whose thoughts are always found
to be anticipating his own. Few
readers will care to be constantly
recalling to mind that Virgil
represents enlightened human
reason.  But even if we confine
ourselves to the easiest sense
of the narrative, the study of the
relations between him and
Dante will be found one of the
most interesting suggested by
the poem—perhaps only less so
than that of Dante’s moods of
wonder, anger, and pity.</p></div>

mythical king of Spain, converted
here into the symbol of
fraud, and set as the guardian
demon of the Eighth Circle,
where the fraudulent are punished.
There is nothing in the
mythology to justify this account
of Geryon; and it seems that
Dante has created a monster to
serve his purpose. Boccaccio,
in his <i>Genealogy of the Gods</i>
(Lib. i.), repeats the description
of Geryon given by ‘Dante the
Florentine, in his poem written
in the Florentine tongue, one
certainly of no little importance
among poems;’ and adds that
Geryon reigned in the Balearic
Isles, and was used to decoy
travellers with his benignant
countenance, caressing words,
and every kind of friendly lure,
and then to murder them when
asleep.</p></div>

confines the brook but the inner
limit of the Seventh Circle, from
which the precipice sinks sheer

beckoned Geryon to come to
that part of the bank which adjoins
the end of the causeway.</p></div>

second and last time that, in
their course through Inferno,
they turn to the right. See <i>Inf.</i>
ix. 132. The action may possibly
have a symbolical meaning,
and refer to the protection
against fraud which is obtained
by keeping to a righteous course.
But here, in fact, they have no
choice, for, traversing the Inferno
as they do to the left hand, they
came to the right bank of the
stream which traverses the fiery
sands, followed it, and now,
when they would leave its edge,
it is from the right embankment
that they have to step down, and
necessarily to the right hand.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_504_504" id="Footnote_504_504"></a><a href="#FNanchor_504_504"><span class="label">[504]</span></a> <i>A half score steps, etc.</i>:
Traversing the stone-built border
which lies between the sand
and the precipice. Had the
brook flowed to the very edge
of the Seventh Circle before
tumbling down the rocky wall
it is clear that they might have
kept to the embankment until
they were clear beyond the edge
of the sand. We are therefore to
figure to ourselves the water as
plunging down at a point some
yards, perhaps the width of the
border, short of the true limit of
the circle; and this is a touch
of local truth, since waterfalls
in time always wear out a
funnel for themselves by eating
back the precipice down which
they tumble. It was into this
funnel that Virgil flung the cord,
and up it that Geryon was seen
to ascend, as if by following
up the course of the water he
would find out who had made
the signal. To keep to the narrow
causeway where it ran on
by the edge of this gulf would
seem too full of risk.</p></div>

guilty of the unnatural sin of
contemning the legitimate modes
of human industry. They sit
huddled up on the sand, close

from which Dante looks down
on them. But that the usurers
are not found only at the edge
of the plain is evident from <i>Inf.</i>
xiv. 19.</p></div>

most of the group prove to be
from Florence Dante recognises
none of them; and this denotes
that nothing so surely creates a
second nature in a man, in a
bad sense, as setting the heart
on money. So in the Fourth
Circle those who, being unable
to spend moderately, are always
thinking of how to keep or get
money are represented as ‘obscured
from any recognition’
(<i>Inf.</i> vii. 44).</p></div>

Cavalier;’ identified by his
arms as Ser Giovanni Buiamonte,
still alive in Florence in 1301,
and if we are to judge from the
text, the greatest usurer of all. A
northern poet of the time would
have sought his usurers in the
Jewry of some town he knew,
but Dante finds his among the
nobles of Padua and Florence.
He ironically represents them
as wearing purses ornamented
with their coats of arms, perhaps
to hint that they pursued their
dishonourable trade under shelter
of their noble names—their
shop signs, as it were. The
whole passage may have been
planned by Dante so as to
afford him the opportunity of
damning the still living Buiamonte
without mentioning his

obstacle in the nature of the

bank sloping down to the Fifth

is described as terrible (<i>Inf.</i>
vii. 105). The descent into the
Seventh Circle is made practicable,
and nothing more (<i>Inf.</i>
xii. I).</p></div>

beginning the descent they had
left the waterfall on the left

one or more great circles, passes
in front of it, and then they
have it on the right. There is
no further mention of the waters
of Phlegethon till they are
found frozen in Cocytus (<i>Inf.</i>
xxxii. 23). Philalethes suggests
that they flow under the Eighth

descended thus deliberately
owing to the command of Virgil.</p></div>

in which the fraudulent of all
species are punished, lies between
the precipice and the
Ninth Circle. A vivid picture
of the enormous height of the
enclosing wall has been presented
to us at the close of the
preceding Canto. As in the
description of the Second Circle
the atmosphere is represented
as malignant, being murky
and disturbed with tempest;
so the Malebolge is called
malignant too, being all of
barren iron-coloured rock. In
both cases the surroundings of
the sinners may well be spoken
of as malign, adverse to
any thought of goodwill and
joy.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_518_518" id="Footnote_518_518"></a><a href="#FNanchor_518_518"><span class="label">[518]</span></a> <i>The extremities</i>: The <i>Malebolge</i>
consists of ten circular pits
or fosses, one inside of another.
The outermost lies under the
precipice which falls sheer from
the Seventh Circle; the innermost,
and of course the smallest,
runs immediately outside of the
‘Well,’ which is the Ninth
Circle. The Bolgias or valleys
are divided from each other by
rocky banks; and, each Bolgia
being at a lower level than the
one that encloses it, the inside
of each bank is necessarily
deeper than the outside. Ribs
or ridges of rock—like spokes
of a wheel to the axle-tree—run
from the foot of the precipice to
the outer rim of the ‘Well,’
vaulting the moats at right
angles with the course of them.
Thus each rib takes the form of
a ten-arched bridge. By one or
other of these Virgil and Dante
now travel towards the centre
and the base of Inferno; their
general course being downward,
though varied by the ascent in
turn of the hog-backed arches
over the moats.</p></div>

the First Bolgia are divided into
two gangs, moving in opposite
directions, the course of those
on the outside being to the
right, as looked at by Dante.
These are the shades of panders;
those in the inner current are
such as seduced on their own
account. Here a list of the
various classes of sinners contained
in the Bolgias of the
Eighth Circle may be given:—

John’s, in Dante’s time, as now,
the Baptistery of Florence. In
<i>Parad.</i> xxv. he anticipates the
day, if it should ever come, when
he shall return to Florence, and
in the church where he was baptized
a Christian be crowned as
a Poet. Down to the middle of
the sixteenth century all baptisms,
except in cases of urgent
necessity, were celebrated in St.
John’s; and, even there, only on
the eves of Easter and Pentecost.
For protection against the crowd,
the officiating priests were provided
with standing-places, circular
cavities disposed around
the great font. To these Dante
compares the holes of this Bolgia,
for the sake of introducing a defence
of himself from a charge
of sacrilege. Benvenuto tells
that once when some boys were
playing about the church one of
them, to hide himself from his
companions, squeezed himself
into a baptizer’s standing-place,
and made so tight a fit of it that
he could not be rescued till
Dante with his own hands plied
a hammer upon the marble,
and so saved the child from
drowning. The presence of
water in the cavity may be explained
by the fact of the church’s
being at that time lighted by an
unglazed opening in the roof;
and as baptisms were so infrequent
the standing-places, situated
as they were in the centre
of the floor, may often have been
partially flooded. It is easy to
understand how bitterly Dante
would resent a charge of irreverence
connected with his
‘beautiful St. John’s;’ ‘that
fair sheep-fold’ (<i>Parad.</i> xxv. 5).</p></div>

times the punishment of an assassin
was to be stuck head
downward in a pit, and then to
have earth slowly shovelled in
till he was suffocated. Dante
bends down, the better to hear
what the sinner has to say, like
a friar recalled by the felon on
the pretence that he has something
to add to his confession.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_540_540" id="Footnote_540_540"></a><a href="#FNanchor_540_540"><span class="label">[540]</span></a> <i>The prophecy</i>: ‘The writing.’
The speaker is Nicholas
<span class="smcap">III.</span>, of the great Roman family
of the Orsini, and Pope from
1277 to 1280; a man of remarkable
bodily beauty and grace of
manner, as well as of great force
of character. Like many other
Holy Fathers he was either a
great hypocrite while on his promotion,
or else he degenerated
very quickly after getting himself
well settled on the Papal
Chair. He is said to have been
the first Pope who practised
simony with no attempt at concealment.
Boniface <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>, whom
he is waiting for to relieve him,
became Pope in 1294, and died
in 1303. None of the four Popes
between 1280 and 1294 were
simoniacs; so that Nicholas was
uppermost in the hole for twenty-three
years. Although ignorant
of what is now passing on the
earth, he can refer back to his
foreknowledge of some years
earlier (see <i>Inf.</i> x. 99) as if to a
prophetic writing, and finds that
according to this it is still three
years too soon, it being now
only 1300, for the arrival of
Boniface. This is the usual
explanation of the passage. To it
lies the objection that foreknowledge
of the present that can be
referred back to is the same
thing as knowledge of it, and
with this the spirits in Inferno
are not endowed. But Dante
elsewhere shows that he finds it
hard to observe the limitation.
The alternative explanation,
supported by the use of <i>scritto</i>
(writing) in the text, is that
Nicholas refers to some prophecy
once current about his successors
in Rome.</p></div>

Boniface died in 1303, and was
succeeded by Benedict <span class="smcap">XI.</span>, who
in his turn was succeeded by
Clement <span class="smcap">V.</span>, the Pastor from the
West. Benedict was not stained
with simony, and so it is Clement
that is to relieve Boniface; and
he is to come from the West,
that is, from Avignon, to which
the Holy See was removed by
him. Or the reference may
simply be to the country of his
birth. Elsewhere he is spoken
of as ‘the Gascon who shall cheat
the noble Henry’ of Luxemburg
(<i>Parad.</i> xvii. 82).—This passage
has been read as throwing light
on the question of when the
<i>Inferno</i> was written. Nicholas
says that from the time Boniface
arrives till Clement relieves
him will be a shorter period than
that during which he has himself
been in Inferno, that is to say,
a shorter time than twenty years.
Clement died in 1314; and so,
it is held, we find a date before
which the <i>Inferno</i> was, at least,
not published. But Clement
was known for years before his
death to be ill of a disease usually
soon fatal. He became Pope
in 1305, and the wonder was that
he survived so long as nine
years. Dante keeps his prophecy
safe—if it is a prophecy;
and there does seem internal
evidence to prove the publication
of the <i>Inferno</i> to have taken
place long before 1314.—It is
needless to point out how the
censure of Clement gains in force
if read as having been published
before his death.</p></div>

They were industrious in

kindred; Boniface, for example,
besides Cardinals, appointed
about twenty Archbishops and
Bishops from among his own

Popes have to be contented

may be thrown on this unusual,
and, at first sight, inexplicable
display of pity, by the comment
of Benvenuto da Imola:—‘It is
the wisest and most virtuous of
men that are most subject to
this mania of divination; and of
this Dante is himself an instance,
as is well proved by this
book of his.’ Dante reminds
the reader how often since the
journey began he has sought to
have the veil of the future lifted;
and would have it understood
that he was seized by a sudden
misgiving as to whether he too
had not overstepped the bounds
of what, in that respect, is
allowed and right.</p></div>

century Alberto Casalodi was

Mantua by Pinamonte Buonacolsi.
Benvenuto tells the tale
as follows:—Pinamonte was a
bold, ambitious man, with a
great troop of armed followers;
and, the nobility being at that
time in bad odour with the
people at large, he persuaded
the Count Albert that it would
be a popular measure to banish
the suspected nobles for a time.
Hardly was this done when he
usurped the lordship; and by
expelling some of the citizens
and putting others of them to
death he greatly thinned the
population of the city.</p></div>

Dante defines Comedy as being
written in a style inferior to
that of Tragedy, and as having a
sad beginning and a happy ending
(Epistle to Can Grande, 10).
Elsewhere he allows the comic
poet great licence in the use of
common language (<i>Vulg. El.</i>
ii. 4). By calling his own poem
a Comedy he, as it were, disarms
criticism.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_571_571" id="Footnote_571_571"></a><a href="#FNanchor_571_571"><span class="label">[571]</span></a> <i>Michael Scott</i>: Of Balwearie
in Scotland, familiar to English
readers through the <i>Lay of the
Last Minstrel</i>. He flourished in
the course of the thirteenth
century, and made contributions
to the sciences, as they were
then deemed, of astrology,
alchemy, and physiognomy.
He acted for some time as
astrologer to the Emperor
Frederick <span class="smcap">II.</span>, and the tradition of
his accomplishments powerfully
affected the Italian imagination
for a century after his death. It
was remembered that the terrible
Frederick, after being warned by
him to beware of Florence, had
died at a place called Firenzuola;
and more than one Italian city
preserved with fear and trembling
his dark sayings regarding
their fate. Villani frequently
quotes his prophecies; and
Boccaccio speaks of him as a
great necromancer who had been
in Florence. A commentary of
his on Aristotle was printed at
Venice in 1496. The thinness
of his flanks may refer to a
belief that he could make himself
invisible at will.</p></div>

credited with helping his master

He is given in the <i>Convito</i> (iv.

moon. The belief that the spots
in the moon are caused by Cain
standing in it with a bundle of
thorns is referred to at <i>Parad.</i>
ii. 51. Although it is now the
morning of the Saturday, the
‘yesternight’ refers to the night
of Thursday, when Dante found
some use of the moon in the
Forest. The moon is now setting
on the line dividing the
hemisphere of Jerusalem, in
which they are, from that of the
Mount of Purgatory. According
to Dante’s scheme of the
world, Purgatory is the true opposite
of Jerusalem; and Seville
is ninety degrees from Jerusalem.
As it was full moon the night
before last, and the moon is
now setting, it is now fully an
hour after sunrise. But, as has
already been said, it is not possible
to reconcile the astronomical
indications thoroughly with
one another.—Virgil serves as
clock to Dante, for they can see
nothing of the skies.</p></div>

<span class="i0">He shot him down, and o’er the cliff began<br></span>

<span class="i1">Chasing a robber, swifter ever ran.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The other sank, then rose with back bent round;<br></span>

<span class="i1">On which one moved, the others standing still.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He coming said: ‘What will this<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> help him here?’<br></span>

<span class="i0">Then was his haughty spirit so depressed,<br></span>

references, that there was such
a place as Venice in the Italy of
Dante. Unlike the statue of

was a holy serving-woman of
Lucca, who died some time between
1270 and 1280, and whose
miracle-working body is still
preserved in the church of San
Frediano. Most probably, although
venerated as a saint, she
was not yet canonized at the
time Dante writes of, and there
may be a Florentine sneer
hidden in the description of
Lucca as her town. Even in
Lucca there was some difference
of opinion as to her merits, and
a certain unlucky Ciappaconi
was pitched into the Serchio for
making fun of the popular enthusiasm
about her. See Philalethes,
<i>Gött. Com.</i> In Lucca
the officials that were called
Priors in Florence, were named
Elders. The commentators
give a name to this sinner, but
it is only guesswork.</p></div>

It is the barrators, those who
trafficked in offices and sold
justice, that are punished in this
Bolgia. The greatest barrator
of all in Lucca, say the commentators,
was this Bonturo; but
there seems no proof of it,
though there is of his arrogance.
He was still living in 1314.</p></div>

An image in cedar wood, of
Byzantine workmanship, still
preserved and venerated in the
cathedral of Lucca. According
to the legend, it was carved from
memory by Nicodemus, and
after being a long time lost was
found again in the eighth century
by an Italian bishop travelling
in Palestine. He brought it
to the coast at Joppa, where it
was received by a vessel without
sail or oar, which, with its sacred
freight, floated westwards and
was next seen at the port of
Luna. All efforts to approach
the bark were vain, till the
Bishop of Lucca descended to
the seashore, and to him the
vessel resigned itself and suffered
him to take the image into his
keeping. ‘Believe what you
like of all this,’ says Benvenuto;
‘it is no article of faith.’—The
sinner has come to the surface,
bent as if in an attitude of
prayer, when he is met by this
taunt.</p></div>

the same stronghold by the
Pisans in the following year,
when the Lucchese garrison,

them. It will be remembered

into the central well of Inferno.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_590_590" id="Footnote_590_590"></a><a href="#FNanchor_590_590"><span class="label">[590]</span></a> <i>Yestreen, etc.</i>: This is the
principal passage in the <i>Comedy</i>
for fixing the date of the journey.
It is now, according to the text,
twelve hundred and sixty-six
years and a day since the crucifixion.
Turning to the <i>Convito</i>,
iv. 23, we find Dante giving his
reasons for believing that Jesus,
at His death, had just completed
His thirty-fourth year. This
brings us to the date of 1300
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> But according to Church
tradition the crucifixion happened
on the 25th March, and
to get thirty-four years His life
must be counted from the incarnation,
which was held to have
taken place on the same date,
namely the 25th March. It
was in Dante’s time optional to
reckon from the incarnation or
the birth of Christ. The journey
must therefore be taken to have
begun on Friday the 25th March,
a fortnight before the Good
Friday of 1300; and, counting
strictly from the incarnation, on
the first day of 1301—the first
day of the new century. So we
find Boccaccio in his unfinished
commentary saying in <i>Inf.</i> iii.
that it will appear from Canto
xxi. that Dante began his journey
in <span class="smcap">MCCCI.</span>—The hour is now
five hours before that at which
the earthquake happened which
took place at the death of Jesus.
This is held by Dante (<i>Convito</i>
iv. 23), who professes to follow
the account by Saint Luke, to
have been at the sixth hour,
that is, at noon; thus the time is
now seven in the morning.</p></div>

the devils are all descriptive:
Alichino, for instance, is the
Swooper; but in this and the
next Canto we have enough of
the horrid crew without considering
too closely how they
are called.</p></div>

The demons, aware of the cheat
played by Malacoda, show their
devilish humour by making
game of Virgil and Dante.—Benvenuto
is amazed that a
man so involved in his own
thoughts as Dante was, should
have been such a close observer
of low life as this passage shows
him. He is sure that he laughed
to himself as he wrote the Canto.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_594_594" id="Footnote_594_594"></a><a href="#FNanchor_594_594"><span class="label">[594]</span></a> <i>O Aretines</i>: Dante is mentioned
as having taken part in
the campaign of 1289 against
Arezzo, in the course of which
the battle of Campaldino was
fought. But the text can hardly
refer to what he witnessed in
that campaign, as the field of
it was almost confined to the
Casentino, and little more than
a formal entrance was made on
the true Aretine territory; while
the chronicles make no mention
of jousts and forays. There is,
however, no reason to think but
that Dante was engaged in the
attack made by Florence on the
Ghibeline Arezzo in the early
summer of the preceding year.
In a few days the Florentines
and their allies had taken above
forty castles and strongholds, and
devastated the enemy’s country
far and near; and, though unable
to take the capital, they held all
kinds of warlike games in front
of it. Dante was then twenty-three
years of age, and according
to the Florentine constitution of
that period would, in a full
muster of the militia, be required
to serve as a cavalier without
pay, and providing his own
horse and arms.</p></div>

the barrators took toll of the
administration of justice and
appointment to offices, something
always sticking to their
palms, so now they are plunged
in the pitch; and as they denied
to others what should be the
common blessing of justice, now
they cannot so much as breathe
the air without paying dearly
for it to the demons.</p></div>

Enzo, King of Sardinia, married
Adelasia, the lady of Logodoro,
one of the four Sardinian
judgedoms or provinces. Of this
province Zanche, seneschal to
Enzo, acquired the government
during the long imprisonment of
his master, or upon his death
in 1273. Zanche’s daughter was
married to Branca d’Oria, by
whom Zanche was treacherously
slain in 1275 (<i>Inf.</i> xxxiii. 137).
There seems to be nothing
extant to support the accusation
implied in the text.</p></div>

experience of Sardinia was of an
earlier date than Gomita’s. It
has been claimed for, or charged
against, the Sardinians, that
more than other men they delight
in gossip touching their
native country. These two, if it
can be supposed that, plunged
among and choked with pitch,
they still cared for Sardinian
talk, would find material enough
in the troubled history of their
land. In 1300 it belonged
partly to Genoa and partly to
Pisa.</p></div>

the devils are standing; neither

figure them to ourselves as standing
on a ledge running between
the fosse and the foot of the
enclosing rocky steep—a pathway
continued under the
bridges and all round the Bolgia
for their convenience as guardians
of it. The bank adjoining
the pitch will serve as a screen
for the sinner if the demons retire
to the other side of this ledge.</p></div>

There seems some incongruity
between Virgil’s dread of these
smaller devils and the ease with
which he cowed Minos, Charon,
and Pluto. But his character
gains in human interest the
more he is represented as
sympathising with Dante in his
terrors; and in this particular
case the confession of fellow-feeling
prepares the way for
the beautiful passage which follows
it (line 38, etc.), one full
of an almost modern tenderness.</p></div>

Clugny, the great Benedictine
monastery; but all the old
commentators and most of the

the text necessarily carries is
that the cloaks had great hoods.

clumsiness is implied, it would
agree well enough with the
Italian estimate of German
people and things.</p></div>

crowd of shades, all like themselves
weighed down by the
leaden cloaks. There is nothing
in all literature like this picture
of the heavily-burdened shades.
At first sight it seems to be
little of a torture compared with
what we have already seen, and
yet by simple touch after touch
an impression is created of the
intolerable weariness of the victims.
As always, too, the punishment
answers to the sin.
The hypocrites made a fair
show in the flesh, and now
their mantles which look like
gold are only of base lead. On
earth they were of a sad countenance,
trying to seem better
than they were, and the load
which to deceive others they
voluntarily assumed in life is
now replaced by a still heavier
weight, and one they cannot
throw off if they would. The
choice of garb conveys an obvious
charge of hypocrisy against
the Friars, then greatly fallen
away from the purity of their
institution, whether Franciscans
or Dominicans.</p></div>

Dante is known for a
mortal by his casting a shadow.
Here he is known to be of flesh
and blood by the act of respiration;
yet, as appears from line
113, the shades, too, breathe as
well as perform other functions
of living bodies. At least they
seem so to do, but this is all
only in appearance. They only
seem to be flesh and blood,
having no weight, casting no
shadow, and drawing breath in
a way of their own. Dante, as
has been said (<i>Inf.</i> vi. 36), is
hard put to it to make them
subject to corporal pains and
yet be only shadows.</p></div>

the name of Frati Godenti which
they here bear was one of reproach

of the easy rule under which
they lived, is not known. Married
men might, under certain
conditions, enter the Order. The
members were to hold themselves
aloof from public office,
and were to devote themselves
to the defence of the weak and
the promotion of justice and
religion. The two monkish
cavaliers of the text were in
1266 brought to Florence as
Podestas, the Pope himself having
urged them to go. There is
much uncertainty as to the part
they played in Florence, but
none as to the fact of their rule
having been highly distasteful to
the Florentines, or as to the
other fact, that in Florence they
grew wealthy. The Podesta,
or chief magistrate, was always
a well-born foreigner. Probably
some monkish rule or custom
forbade either Catalano or Loderingo
to leave the monastery
singly.</p></div>

as the spectacle of the green

the wall they come to last—that

Further on they climb up again
(<i>Inf.</i> xxvi. 13) by the projecting
stones which now supply them
with the means of descent. It
is a disputed point how far they
do descend.  Clearly it is
further than merely from the
bridge to the lower level of the
wall dividing the Seventh from
the Eighth Bolgia; but not so
far as to the ground of the moat.
Most likely the stones jut forth
at the angle formed by the
junction of the bridge and the
rocky wall. On one of the
lowest of these they find a
standing-place whence they can
see clearly what is in the
Bolgia.</p></div>

hands are firmly bound
behind them.</p></div>

of the thieves, if looked
closely into, will be found appropriate
to their sins. They
would fain but cannot steal
themselves away, and in addition
to the constant terror of
being found out they are subject
to pains the essence of
which consists in the deprivation—the
theft from them—of
their unsubstantial bodies, which
are all that they now have to
lose. In the case of this victim
the deprivation is only temporary.</p></div>

to find out why Fucci is placed
among the thieves, and not in
the circle of the violent. The
question is framed so as to
compel confession of a crime
for which the sinner had not
been condemned in life; and
he flushes with rage at being
found among the cowardly
thieves.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_646_646" id="Footnote_646_646"></a><a href="#FNanchor_646_646"><span class="label">[646]</span></a> <i>I’m plunged, etc.</i>: Fucci was concerned
in the theft of treasure from the Cathedral
Church of St. James at Pistoia.
Accounts vary as to the circumstances
under which the crime
was committed, and as to who
suffered for it. Neither is it
certainly known when Fucci
died, though his recent arrival
in the Bolgia agrees with the
view that he was still active on
the side of the Blacks in the
last year of the century. In the
fierceness of his retort to Dante
we have evidence of their old
acquaintance and old enmity.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_647_647" id="Footnote_647_647"></a><a href="#FNanchor_647_647"><span class="label">[647]</span></a> <i>Lest thou shouldst joy</i>: Vanni,
a <i>Nero</i> or Black, takes his revenge
for being found here by
Dante, who was, as he knew,
associated with the <i>Bianchi</i> or
Whites, by prophesying an event
full of disaster to these.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_648_648" id="Footnote_648_648"></a><a href="#FNanchor_648_648"><span class="label">[648]</span></a> <i>Every Bianco, etc.</i>: The
Blacks, according to Villani
(viii. 45), were driven from Pistoia
in May 1301. They took
refuge in Florence, where their
party, in the following November
under the protection of Charles
of Valois, finally gained the
upper hand, and began to persecute
and expel the Whites,
among whom was Dante. Mars,
the god of war, or, more probably, the planet of war, draws a
vapour from the valley of the
Magra, a small stream which
flows into the Mediterranean on
the northern confine of Tuscany.
This vapour is said to
signify Moroello Malaspina, a
noble of that district and an
active leader of the Blacks, who
here figure as murky clouds.
The Campo Piceno is the
country west of Pistoia. There
Moroello bursts on his foes like
a lightning-flash out of its cloud.
This seems to refer to a pitched
battle that should have happened
soon after the Blacks recovered
their strength; but the chroniclers
tell of none such, though
some of the commentators do.
The fortress of Seravalle was
taken from the Pistoiese, it is
true, in 1302, and Moroello is
said to have been the leader of
the force which starved it into
submission. He was certainly
present at the great siege of
Pistoia in 1305, when the citizens
suffered the last rigours of
famine.—This prophecy by
Fucci recalls those by Farinata
and Ciacco.</p></div>

his prophecy Fucci has, after a
fashion, taken revenge on Dante
for being found by him among
the cheating thieves instead of
among the nobler sinners guilty
of blood and violence. But in
the rage of his wounded pride
he must insult even Heaven, and
this he does by using the most
contemptuous gesture in an
Italian’s repertory. The fig is
made by thrusting the thumb
between the next two fingers.
In the English ‘A fig for
him!’ we have a reference to
the gesture.</p></div>

the reputation of being hard and
pitiless. The tradition was that
their city had been founded by
such of Catiline’s followers as
survived his defeat on the Campo
Piceno. ‘It is no wonder,’
says Villani (i. 32) ‘that, being
the descendants as they are of
Catiline and his followers, the
Pistoiese have always been ruthless
and cruel to strangers and
to one another.’</p></div>

interrupted by the arrival of
three sinners whom Dante
does not at first recognise as he
gazes down on them, but only
when they begin to speak among
themselves. They are three
noble citizens of Florence:
Agnello Brunelleschi, Buoso
degli Abati, and Puccio Sciancatto
de’ Galigai—all said to
have pilfered in private life, or
to have abused their tenure of
high office by plundering the
Commonwealth. What is certainly
known of them is that
they were Florentine thieves of
quality.</p></div>

<i>papiro</i>, the word used in Dante’s
time for a wick made out of a
reed like the papyrus; <i>papér</i>
being still the name for a wick in
some dialects.—(Scartazzini.) It
cannot be shown that <i>papiro</i>
was ever employed for paper in
Italian. This, however, does
not prove that Dante may not so
use it in this instance, adopting
it from the Latin <i>papyrus</i>.
Besides, he says that the brown
colour travels up over the <i>papiro</i>;
while it goes downward on a
burning wick. Nor would the
simile, if drawn from a slowly
burning lamp-wick, agree with
the speed of the change described
in the text.</p></div>

from the last line of the Canto,
this is Francesco, of the Florentine
family of the Cavalcanti, to
which Dante’s friend Guido
belonged. He wounds Buoso
in the navel, and then, instead of
growing into one new monster
as was the case with Cianfa and
Agnello, they exchange shapes,
and when the transformation is
complete Buoso is the serpent
and Francesco is the human
shade.</p></div>

<i>form</i> is here to be taken in its
scholastic sense of <i>virtus formativa</i>,
the inherited power of
modifying matter into an organised
body. ‘This, united to the
divinely implanted spark of reason,’
says Philalethes, ‘constitutes,
on Dante’s system, a human
soul. Even after death this
power continues to be an essential
constituent of the soul, and
constructs out of the elements
what seems to be a body. Here
the sinners exchange the matter
they have thus made their own,
each retaining, however, his proper
plastic energy as part of his
soul.’ Dante in his <i>Convito</i>
(iii. 2) says that ‘the human
soul is the noblest form of all
that are made under the heavens,
receiving more of the Divine
nature than any other.’</p></div>

was slain by the people of Gaville
in the upper Valdarno. Many
of them were in their turn slaughtered
in revenge by the Cavalcanti
and their associates. It
should be remarked that some
of these five Florentines were of
one party, some of the other. It
is also noteworthy that Dante
recruits his thieves as he did his
usurers from the great Florentine
families.—As the ‘shifting and
changing’ of this rubbish is apt
to be found confusing, the following
may be useful to some
readers:—There first came on
the scene Agnello, Buoso, and
Puccio. Cianfa, in the shape
of a six-footed serpent, comes
and throws himself on Agnello,
and then, grown incorporate in
a new strange monster, two in
one, they disappear. Buoso
is next wounded by Francesco,
and they exchange members
and bodies. Only Puccio remains
unchanged.</p></div>

There is here a sudden change
from irony to earnest. ‘Five
members of great Florentine
families, eternally engaged
among themselves in their
shameful metamorphoses—nay,
but it is too sad!’</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_669_669" id="Footnote_669_669"></a><a href="#FNanchor_669_669"><span class="label">[669]</span></a> <i>Toward the morning, etc.</i>:
There was a widespread belief
in the greater truthfulness of
dreams dreamed as the night
wears away. See <i>Purg.</i> ix. 13.
The dream is Dante’s foreboding
of what is to happen to Florence.
Of its truth he has no doubt,
and the only question is how
soon will it be answered by the
fact. Soon, he says, if it is near
to the morning that we dream
true dreams—morning being the
season of waking reality in
which dreams are accomplished.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_670_670" id="Footnote_670_670"></a><a href="#FNanchor_670_670"><span class="label">[670]</span></a> <i>Even Prato</i>: A small neighbouring
city, much under the
influence of Florence, and somewhat
oppressed by it. The
commentators reckon up the
disasters that afflicted Florence
in the first years of the fourteenth
century, between the
date of Dante’s journey and the
time he wrote—fires, falls of
bridges, and civil strife. But
such misfortunes were too much
in keeping with the usual course
of Florentine history to move
Dante thus deeply in the retrospect; and as he speaks here
in his own person the ‘soon’ is
more naturally counted from the
time at which he writes than
from the date assigned by him to
his pilgrimage. He is looking
forward to the period when his
own return in triumph to Florence
was to be prepared by
grievous national reverses; and,
as a patriot, he feels that he
cannot be wholly reconciled by
his private advantage to the
public misfortune. But it was
all only a dream.</p></div>

From <i>Inf.</i> xxiv. 63 we have
learned that the rib of rock, on

overhang the various Bolgias, is
rougher and worse to follow
than that by which they began
their passage towards the centre

xv. 55. Dante seems to have
been uncertain what credence to
give to the claims of astrology.
In a passage of the <i>Purgatorio</i>
(xvi. 67) he tries to establish
that whatever influence the stars
may possess over us we can
never, except with our own
consent, be influenced by them
to evil.—His sorrow here, as
elsewhere, is not wholly a feeling
of pity for the suffering shades,
but is largely mingled with misgivings
for himself. The punishment of those to whose sins
he feels no inclination he always
beholds with equanimity. Here,
as he looks down upon the false
counsellors and considers what
temptations there are to misapply
intellectual gifts, he is
smitten with dread lest his lot
should one day be cast in that
dismal valley and he find cause
to regret that the talent of genius
was ever committed to him.
The memory even of what he
saw makes him recollect himself
and resolve to be wary. Then,
as if to justify the claim to superior
powers thus clearly implied,
there comes a passage which in
the original is of uncommon
beauty.</p></div>

those ancient Greeks were
all so haughty that to a common
modern mortal they would have
nothing to say. He, as the

There seems no reason for supposing,
with Philalethes, that
Ulysses is here represented as
sailing on his last voyage from
the island of Circe and not from
Ithaca. Ulysses, on the contrary,
represents himself as
breaking away afresh from all
the ties of home. According to
Homer, Ulysses had lost all his
companions ere he returned to
Ithaca; and in the <i>Odyssey</i>
Tiresias prophesies to him that
his last wanderings are to be
inland. But any acquaintance
that Dante had with Homer
can only have been vague and
fragmentary. He may have
founded his narrative of how
Ulysses ended his days upon
some floating legend; or, eager
to fill up what he took to be a
blank in the world of imagination,
he may have drawn wholly
on his own creative power. In
any case it is his Ulysses
who, through the version of
him given by a living poet, is
most familiar to the English
reader.</p></div>

Italy lying on the Adriatic,
south of the Po and east of Tuscany,
of which Bologna and the
cities named in the text were
the principal towns. During
the last quarter of the thirteenth
century it was the scene of constant
wars promoted in the interest
of the Church, which
claimed Romagna as the gift
of the Emperor Rudolf, and in
that of the great nobles of the
district, who while using the
Guelf and Ghibeline war-cries
aimed at nothing but the lordship
of the various cities. Foremost
among these nobles was
he with whose shade Dante
speaks. Villani calls him ‘the
most sagacious and accomplished
warrior of his time in Italy’
(<i>Cronica</i>, vii. 80). He was possessed
of lands of his own near
Forlì and Cesena, and was lord
in turn of many of the Romagnese
cities. On the whole he appears
to have remained true to his
Ghibeline colours in spite of
Papal fulminations, although
once and again he was reconciled
to the Church; on the last occasion
in 1294. In the years immediately
before this he had greatly
distinguished himself as a wise
governor and able general in the
service of the Ghibeline Pisa—or
rather as the paid lord of it.</p></div>

neighbouring town of Cervia
were in 1300 under the lordship
of members of the Polenta
family—the father and brothers
of the ill-fated Francesca (<i>Inf.</i>
v.). Their arms were an eagle,
half white on an azure and half
red on a gold field. It was in
the court of the generous Guido,
son of one of these brothers,
that Dante was to find his last
refuge and to die.</p></div>

The reference is to one of the
most brilliant feats of war performed
by Guido of Montefeltro.
Frenchmen formed great part of
an army sent in 1282 against
Forlì by the Pope, Martin <span class="smcap">IV.</span>,
himself a Frenchman. Guido,
then lord of the city, led them
into a trap and overthrew them
with great slaughter. Like most
men of his time Guido was a
believer in astrology, and is said
on this occasion to have acted
on the counsel of Guido Bonatti,
mentioned among the diviners
in the Fourth Bolgia (<i>Inf.</i> xx.
118).</p></div>

under whose command the
exiled Florentines put themselves
for a time, and there is
even a tradition that he acted as

called the Mastiffs on account of
their cruel tenacity. The elder
was the father of Francesca’s
husband and lover; the younger
was a brother of these.</p></div>

Parcitati, one of a Ghibeline

set in him to such purpose that
he soon died in his dungeon.</p></div>

Pagani, lord of these towns, had
for arms an azure lion on a white

Florence. By his cunning and
daring he earned the name of the
Demon (<i>Purg.</i> xiv. 118). He
died at Imola in 1302, and was
buried in the garb of a monk
of Vallombrosa. Like most of his
neighbours he changed his party
as often as his interest required.
He was a Guelf in Florence and a
Ghibeline in Romagna, say some.</p></div>

being enveloped in fire, are unable
to see those with whom
they speak; and so Guido does
not detect in Dante the signs of
a living man, but takes him to
be like himself a denizen of
Inferno. He would not have
the truth regarding his fate to
be known in the world, where
he is supposed to have departed
life in the odour of sanctity.
Dante’s promise to refresh his
fame he either regards as meaningless,
or as one made without
the power of fulfilling it. Dante
leaves him in his error, for he
is there to learn all he can, and
not to bandy personal confessions
with the shades.</p></div>

were the Cardinals Peter and

their palace in Rome (1297) and
carried the war against them to

the ancient Præneste, then a
great stronghold. Dante here
bitterly blames Boniface for
instituting a crusade against
Christians at a time when, by
the recent loss of Acre, the gate
of the Holy Land had been lost
to Christendom. The Colonnas
were innocent, too, of the crime
of supplying the Infidel with
munitions of war—a crime
condemned by the Lateran
Council of 1215, and by Boniface
himself, who excluded those
guilty of it from the benefits of
the great Jubilee of 1300.</p></div>

That Guido gave such counsel
is related by a contemporary
chronicler: ‘The Pope said:
Tell me how to get the better of
those mine enemies, thou who
art so knowing in these things.
Then he answered: Promise
much, and perform little; which
he did.’ But it seems odd that
the wily and unscrupulous Boniface
should have needed to put
himself to school for such a
simple lesson.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_713_713" id="Footnote_713_713"></a><a href="#FNanchor_713_713"><span class="label">[713]</span></a> <i>Thou didst not think, etc.</i>:
Guido had forgot that others
could reason besides the Pope.
With regard to the inefficacy
of the Papal absolution an
old commentator says, following
Origen: ‘The Popes that walk in
the footsteps of Peter have this
power of binding and loosing;
but only such as do so walk.’
But on Dante’s scheme of what
fixes the fate of the soul absolution
matters little to save, or
priestly curses to damnify. See
<i>Purg.</i> iii. 133. It is unfeigned
repentance that can help a sinner
even at the last; and it is
remarkable that in the case of
Buonconte, the gallant son of
this same Guido, the infernal
angel who comes for him as he
expires complains that he has
been cheated of his victim by
one poor tear. See <i>Purg.</i> v.
88, etc. Why then is no indulgence
shown in Dante’s court to
Guido, who might well have
been placed in Purgatory and
made to have repented effectually
of this his last sin? That
Dante had any personal grudge
against him we can hardly think.
In the Fourth Book of the
<i>Convito</i> (written, according to
Fraticelli, in 1297), he calls
him ‘our most noble Guido
Montefeltrano;’ and praises
him as one of the wise and noble
souls that refuse to run with full
sails into the port of death, but
furl the sails of their worldly
undertakings, and, relinquishing
all earthly pleasures and business,
give themselves up in
their old age to a religious life.
Either, then, he sets Guido here
in order that he may have a
modern false counsellor worthy
to be ranked with Ulysses; or
because, on longer experience,
he had come to reprobate more
keenly the abuse of the Franciscan
habit; or, most likely of
all, that he might, even at the
cost of Guido, load the hated
memory of Boniface with another
reproach.</p></div>

conquerors of the regions
which up to our own time constituted
the kingdom of Naples.
In Apulia he did much fighting
against Lombards, Saracens,
and Greeks. He is found by
Dante in Paradise among those
who fought for the faith (<i>Par.</i>
xviii. 48). His death happened
in Cephalonia in 1085, at the age
of seventy, when he was engaged
on an expedition against Constantinople.</p></div>

decisive campaign undertaken by
Charles of Anjou against Manfred,
King of Sicily and Naples,
the first victory was obtained at
Ceperano; but it was won owing
to the treachery of Manfred’s
lieutenant, and not by the sword.
The true battle was fought at
Benevento (<i>Purg.</i> iii. 128). Ceperano
may be named by Dante
as the field where the defeat of
Manfred was virtually begun, and
where the Apulians first failed
in loyalty to their gallant king.
Dante was a year old at the time
of Manfred’s overthrow (1266).</p></div>

Charles had won from Manfred
he had to defend against Manfred’s
nephew Conradin (grandson
and last representative of
Frederick <span class="smcap">II.</span> and the legitimate
heir to the kingdom of Sicily),
whom, in 1268, he defeated
near Tagliacozzo in the Abruzzi.
He made his victory the more
complete by acting on the advice
of Alardo or Erard de Valery,
an old Crusader, to hold good
part of his force in reserve.
Charles wrote to the Pope that
the slaughter was so great as far
to exceed that at Benevento.
The feet of all the low-born
prisoners not slain on the field
were cut off, while the gentlemen
were beheaded or hanged.</p></div>

to Dante by M. Littré
that he treats Mahomet, the
founder of a new religion, as a
mere schismatic. The wonder
would have been had he dwelt
on the good qualities of the Prophet
at a time when Islam still
threatened Europe. He goes on
the fact that Mahomet and his
followers rent great part of the
East and South from Christendom;
and for this the Prophet
is represented as being mutilated
in a sorer degree than the other
schismatics.</p></div>

of the thirteenth century, Boniface
being Pope, the general discontent
with the corruption of the
higher clergy found expression in
the north of Italy in the foundation
of a new sect, whose leader
was Fra Dolcino. What he
chiefly was—enthusiast, reformer,
or impostor—it is impossible to
ascertain; all we know of him
being derived from writers in the
Papal interest. Among other
crimes he was charged with that
of teaching the lawfulness of telling
an Inquisitor a lie to save
your life, and with prophesying
the advent of a pious Pope. A
holy war on a small scale was
preached against him. After
suffering the extremities of famine,
snowed up as he was among
the mountains, he was taken
prisoner and cruelly put to death
(1307). It may have been in
order to save himself from being
suspected of sympathy with him,
that Dante, whose hatred of
Boniface and the New Pharisees
was equal to Dolcino’s, provides
for him by anticipation a place
with Mahomet.</p></div>

who, according to Lucan—the

‘No delay! when men are
ready they always suffer by putting
off.’ The passage of the
Rubicon was counted as the
beginning of the Civil War.—Curio
gets scant justice, seeing
that in Dante’s view Cæsar in
all he did was only carrying out
the Divine purpose regarding
the Empire.</p></div>

Florentine family of the Buondelmonti
jilted a daughter of
the Amidei. When these with
their friends met to take counsel
touching revenge for the insult,
Mosca, one of the Uberti or of
the Lamberti, gave his opinion
in the proverb, <i>Cosa fatta ha
capo</i>: ‘A thing once done is done
with.’ The hint was approved
of, and on the following Easter
morning the young Buondelmonte,
as, mounted on a white
steed and dressed in white he
rode across the Ponte Vecchio,
was dragged to the ground and
cruelly slain. All the great
Florentine families took sides
in the feud, and it soon widened
into the civil war between Florentine
Guelf and Ghibeline.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_732_732" id="Footnote_732_732"></a><a href="#FNanchor_732_732"><span class="label">[732]</span></a> <i>Bertrand de Born</i>: Is mentioned
by Dante in his Treatise
<i>De Vulgari Eloquio</i>, ii. 2, as
specially the poet of warlike
deeds. He was a Gascon noble
who used his poetical gift very
much to stir up strife. For
patron he had the Prince Henry,
son of Henry II. of England.
Though Henry never came to
the throne he was, during his
father’s lifetime, crowned as his
successor, and was known as
the young King. After the
death of the Prince, Bertrand
was taken prisoner by the King,
and, according to the legend,
was loaded with favours because
he had been so true a friend to
his young master. That he had
a turn for fomenting discord is
shown by his having also led
a revolt in Aquitaine against
Richard <span class="smcap">I.</span>—All the old <span class="smcap">MSS.</span>
and all the earlier commentators
read <i>Re Giovanni</i>, King John;
<i>Re Giovane</i>, the young King,
being a comparatively modern
emendation. In favour of
adopting this it may be mentioned
that in his poems Bertrand
calls Prince Henry <i>lo Reys
joves</i>, the young King; that it
was Henry and not John that
was his friend and patron; and
that in the old <i>Cento Novelle</i>
Henry is described as the young
King: in favour of the older
reading, that John as well as his
brother was a rebel to Henry;
and that the line is hurt by the
change from <i>Giovanni</i> to <i>Giovane</i>.
Considering that Dante
almost certainly wrote <i>Giovanni</i>
it seems most reasonable to
suppose that he may have confounded
the <i>Re Giovane</i> with
King John.</p></div>

counts more with Dante

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_735_735" id="Footnote_735_735"></a><a href="#FNanchor_735_735"><span class="label">[735]</span></a> <i>Thou didst not, etc.</i>: It is a
noteworthy feature in the conduct
of the Poem that when
Dante has once gained sufficient
knowledge of any group in the
Inferno he at once detaches his
mind from it, and, carrying on as
little arrear of pity as he can,
gives his thoughts to further
progress on the journey. The
departure here made from his
usual behaviour is presently accounted
for. Virgil knows why
he lingers, but will not seem to
approve of the cause.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_736_736" id="Footnote_736_736"></a><a href="#FNanchor_736_736"><span class="label">[736]</span></a> <i>Twenty miles and two</i>: The
Ninth Bolgia has a circumference
of twenty-two miles, and as the
procession of the shades is slow
it would indeed involve a protracted
halt to wait till all had
passed beneath the bridge.
Virgil asks ironically if he
wishes to count them all. This
precise detail, taken along with
one of the same kind in the
following Canto (line 86), has
suggested the attempt to construct
the Inferno to a scale.
Dante wisely suffers us to forget,
if we will, that—taking the diameter
of the earth at 6500 miles,
as given by him in the <i>Convito</i>—he
travels from the surface of
the globe to the centre at the
rate of more than two miles a
minute, counting downward
motion alone. It is only when
he has come to the lowest rings
that he allows himself to give
details of size; and probably
the mention of the extent of the
Ninth Bolgia, which comes on
the reader as a surprise, is
thrown out in order to impress
on the imagination some sense
of the enormous extent of the
regions through which the pilgrim
has already passed.
Henceforth he deals in exact
measurement.</p></div>

Alighieri, a full cousin of Dante’s
father. He was guilty of encouraging
dissension, say the
commentators; which is to be
clearly inferred from the place
assigned him in Inferno: but
they do not agree as to how he
met his death, nor do they mention
the date of it. ‘Not
avenged till thirty years after,’
says Landino; but does not say
if this was after his death or the
time at which Dante writes.</p></div>

though Dante is, he yet
shows himself man of his age
enough to be keenly alive to the
extremest claims of kindred;
and while he condemns the
<i>vendetta</i> by the words put into
Virgil’s mouth, he confesses to
a feeling of meanness not to
have practised it on behoof of a
distant relative. There is a
high art in this introduction of
Geri del Bello. Had they conferred
together Dante must have
seemed either cruel or pusillanimous,
reproaching or being reproached.
As it is, all the
poetry of the situation comes
out the stronger that they do
not meet face to face: the
threatening finger, the questions
hastily put to Geri by the astonished
shades, and his disappearance
under the dark vault
when by the law of his punishment
the sinner can no longer
tarry.</p></div>

used properly describes the Lay
Brothers of a monastery. Philalethes
suggests that Dante
may regard the devils as the
true monks of the monastery of
Malebolge. The simile involves
no contempt for the monastic
life, but is naturally used with
reference to those who live secluded
and under a fixed rule.
He elsewhere speaks of the
College of the Hypocrites (<i>Inf.</i>
xxiii. 91) and of Paradise as the
Cloister where Christ is Abbot
(<i>Purg.</i> xxvi.129).</p></div>

of these to the French
would have the more cogency
as Siena boasted of having been
founded by the Gauls. ‘That
vain people,’ says Dante of the
Sienese in the <i>Purgatory</i> (xiii.
151). Among their neighbours
they still bear the reputation of
light-headedness; also, it ought
to be added, of great urbanity.</p></div>

tell that the two young
Sienese nobles above mentioned
were members of a society
formed for the purpose of living
luxuriously together. Twelve
of them contributed a fund of
above two hundred thousand
gold florins; they built a great
palace and furnished it magnificently,
and launched out into
every other sort of extravagance
with such assiduity that in a
few months their capital was
gone. As that amounted to
more than a hundred thousand
pounds of our money, equal in
those days to a million or two,
the story must be held to savour
of romance. That Dante refers
to a prodigal’s club that actually
existed some time before he
wrote we cannot doubt. But
it seems uncertain, to say the
least, whether the sonnets addressed
by the Tuscan poet
Folgore da Gemignano to a
jovial crew in Siena can be
taken as having been inspired
by the club Dante speaks of.
A translation of them is given
by Mr. Rossetti in his <i>Circle of
Dante</i>. (See Mr. Symonds’s
<i>Renaissance</i>, vol. iv. page 54,
<i>note</i>, for doubts as to the date
of Folgore.)—<i>Caccia d’ Ascian</i>:
Whose short and merry club
life cost him his estates near
Siena.</p></div>

known, though a great deal is
guessed, about this member of
the club. It is enough to know
that, having a scant supply of
wit, he spent it freely.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_758_758" id="Footnote_758_758"></a><a href="#FNanchor_758_758"><span class="label">[758]</span></a> <i>Capocchio</i>: Some one whom
Dante knew. Whether he was
a Florentine or a Sienese is not
ascertained, but from the strain
of his mention of the Sienese we
may guess Florentine. He was
burned in Siena in 1293.—(Scartazzini.)
They had studied
together, says the <i>Anonimo</i>.
Benvenuto tells of him that one
Good Friday, while in a cloister,
he painted on his nail with marvellous
completeness a picture of
the crucifixion. Dante came
up, and was lost in wonder, when
Capocchio suddenly licked his
nail clean—which may be taken
for what it is worth.</p></div>

Acting in the character

Brescia, an accomplished worker
in metals, was induced by the
Counts Guidi of Romena in the
Casentino, the upland district of
the upper Arno, to counterfeit
the gold coin of Florence. This
false coin is mentioned in a
Chronicle as having been in circulation
in 1281. It must therefore
have been somewhat later
that Master Adam was burned,
as he was by sentence of the
Republic, upon the road which
led from Romena to Florence.
A cairn still existing near the
ruined castle bears the name of
the ‘dead man’s cairn.’</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_770_770" id="Footnote_770_770"></a><a href="#FNanchor_770_770"><span class="label">[770]</span></a> <i>The money coined, etc.</i>: The
gold florin, afterwards adopted
in so many countries, was first
struck in 1252; ‘which florins
weighed eight to the ounce, and
bore the lily on the one side, and
on the other Saint John.’—(Villani,
vi. 54.) The piece was
thus of about the weight of our
half-sovereign. The gold was
of twenty-four carats; that is, it
had no alloy. The coin soon
passed into wide circulation, and
to maintain its purity became for
the Florentines a matter of the
first importance. Villani, in the
chapter above cited, tells how
the King of Tunis finding the
florin to be of pure gold sent for
some of the Pisans, then the chief
traders in his ports, and asked
who were the Florentines that
they coined such money. ‘Only
our Arabs,’ was the answer;
meaning that they were rough
country folk, dependent on Pisa.
‘Then what is your coin like?’
he asked. A Florentine of
Oltrarno named Pera Balducci,
who was present, took the opportunity of informing him how
great Florence was compared with Pisa,
as was shown by that
city having no gold coinage of
its own; whereupon the King
made the Florentines free of
Tunis, and allowed them to have
a factory there. ‘And this,’
adds Villani, who had himself
been agent abroad for a great
Florentine house of business,
‘we had at first hand from the
aforesaid Pera, a man worthy of
credit, and with whom we were
associated in the Priorate.’</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_771_771" id="Footnote_771_771"></a><a href="#FNanchor_771_771"><span class="label">[771]</span></a> <i>Guido, etc.</i>: The Guidi of
Romena were a branch of the
great family of the Counts Guidi.
The father of the three brothers
in the text was grandson of the
old Guido that married the
Good Gualdrada, and cousin of
the Guidoguerra met by Dante
in the Seventh Circle (<i>Inf.</i> xvi.
38). How the third brother
was called is not settled, nor
which of the three was already
dead in the beginning of 1300.
The Alexander of Romena, who
for some time was captain of
the banished Florentine Whites,
was, most probably, he of the
text. A letter is extant professing
to be written by Dante<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">to two of Alexander’s nephews</span><br>
on the occasion of his death,
in which the poet excuses himself
for absence from the funeral
on the plea of poverty. By
the time he wrote the <i>Inferno</i>
he may, owing to their shifty
politics, have lost all liking for
the family, yet it seems harsh
measure that is here dealt to
former friends and patrons.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_772_772" id="Footnote_772_772"></a><a href="#FNanchor_772_772"><span class="label">[772]</span></a> <i>Fonte Branda</i>: A celebrated
fountain in the city of
Siena. Near Romena is a
spring which is also named Fonte
Branda; and this, according to
the view now most in favour,
was meant by Master Adam.
But was it so named in Dante’s
time? Or was it not so called
only when the <i>Comedy</i> had
begun to awaken a natural interest
in the old coiner, which
local ingenuity did its best to
meet? The early commentators
know nothing of the Casentino
Fonte Branda, and, though it is
found mentioned under the date
of 1539, that does not take us
far enough back. In favour of
the Sienese fountain is the
consideration that it was the
richest of any in the Tuscan
cities; that it was a great architectural
as well as engineering
work; and that, although now
more than half a century old, it
was still the subject of curiosity
with people far and near. Besides,
Adam has already recalled
the brooks of Casentino, and so
the mention of the paltry spring
at Romena would introduce no
fresh idea like that of the abundant
waters of the great fountain
which daily quenched the
thirst of thousands.</p></div>

about six miles from Siena, of
which ample ruins still exist.
It had no central keep, but
twelve towers rose from its circular
wall like spikes from the
rim of a coronet. They had
been added by the Sienese in
1260, and so were comparatively
new in Dante’s time.—As the
towers stood round Montereggioni
so the giants at regular
intervals stand round the central
pit. They have their foothold
within the enclosing mound;
and thus, to one looking at them
from without, they are hidden by
it up to their middle. As the
embodiment of superhuman impious
strength and pride they
stand for warders of the utmost
reach of Hell.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_786_786" id="Footnote_786_786"></a><a href="#FNanchor_786_786"><span class="label">[786]</span></a> <i>St. Peter’s cone</i>: The great
pine cone of bronze, supposed
to have originally crowned the
mausoleum of Hadrian, lay in
Dante’s time in the forecourt
of St Peter’s. When the new
church was built it was removed
to the gardens of the Vatican,
where it still remains. Its size,
it will be seen, is of importance
as helping us to a notion of the
stature of the giants; and, though
the accounts of its height are
strangely at variance with one
another, I think the measurement
made specially for Philalethes
may be accepted as
substantially correct. According
to that, the cone is ten
palms long—about six feet.
Allowing something for the
neck, down to ‘where a man
clasps his cloak’ (line 66), and
taking the thirty palms as
eighteen feet, we get twenty-six
feet or so for half his height.
The giants vary in bulk; whether
they do so in height is not clear.
We cannot be far mistaken if
we assume them to stand from
fifty to sixty feet high. Virgil
and Dante must throw their
heads well back to look up
into the giant’s face; and Virgil
must raise his voice as he
speaks.—With regard to the
height of the cone it may be
remarked that Murray’s Handbook
for Rome makes it eleven
feet high; Gsell-Fels two and a
half metres, or eight feet and
three inches. It is so placed
as to be difficult of measurement.</p></div>

like the opening line of the
Seventh Canto, have, to no result,
greatly exercised the ingenuity
of scholars. From what
follows it is clear that Dante
meant them to be meaningless.
Part of Nimrod’s punishment is
that he who brought about the
confusion of tongues is now left
with a language all to himself.
It seems strange that commentators
should have exhausted themselves
in searching for a sense
in words specially invented to
have none.—In his <i>De Vulg.
El.</i>, i. 7, Dante enlarges upon
the confusion of tongues, and
speaks of the tower of Babel as
having been begun by men on
the persuasion of a giant.</p></div>

Briareus. Virgil here gives
Dante to know what is the
truth about Briareus (see line
97, etc.). He is not, as he was
fabled, a monster with a hundred
hands, but is like Ephialtes,
only fiercer to see. Hearing himself
thus made light of Ephialtes
trembles with anger, like a
tower rocking in an earthquake.</p></div>

about thirty palms, so that
Antæus is of the same stature as
that assigned to Nimrod at line
65. This supports the view that
the ‘huger’ of line 84 may apply
to breadth rather than to height.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_793_793" id="Footnote_793_793"></a><a href="#FNanchor_793_793"><span class="label">[793]</span></a> <i>The fortune-haunted dell</i>:
The valley of the Bagrada near
Utica, where Scipio defeated
Hannibal and won the surname
of Africanus.  The giant
Antæus had, according to the
legend, lived in that neighbourhood,
with the flesh of lions for
his food and his dwelling in a
cave. He was son of the Earth,
and could not be vanquished so
long as he was able to touch the
ground; and thus ere Hercules
could give him a mortal hug he
needed to swing him aloft. In
the <i>Monarchia</i>, ii. 10, Dante
refers to the combat between
Hercules and Antæus as an instance
of the wager of battle
corresponding to that between
David and Goliath. Lucan’s
<i>Pharsalia</i>, a favourite authority
with Dante, supplies him with
these references to Scipio and
Antæus.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_794_794" id="Footnote_794_794"></a><a href="#FNanchor_794_794"><span class="label">[794]</span></a> <i>Cocytus</i>: The frozen lake

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_795_795" id="Footnote_795_795"></a><a href="#FNanchor_795_795"><span class="label">[795]</span></a> <i>Tityus, etc.</i>: These were
other giants, stated by Lucan to
be less strong than Antæus.
This introduction of their names
is therefore a piece of flattery to
the monster. A light contemptuous
turn is given by Virgil to
his flattery when in the following
sentence he bids Antæus not curl
his snout, but at once comply
with the demand for aid. There
is something genuinely Italian in
the picture given of the giants in
this Canto, as of creatures whose
intellect bears no proportion to
their bulk and brute strength.
Mighty hunters like Nimrod,
skilled in sounding the horn but
feeble in reasoned speech,
Frisians with great thews and
long of limb, and German men-at-arms
who traded in their
rude valour, to the subtle
Florentine in whom the ferment
of the Renaissance was beginning
to work were all specimens
of Nature’s handicraft that had
better have been left unmade,
were it not that wiser people
could use them as tools.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_796_796" id="Footnote_796_796"></a><a href="#FNanchor_796_796"><span class="label">[796]</span></a> <i>Carisenda</i>: A tower still
standing in Bologna, built at the
beginning of the twelfth century,
and, like many others of
its kind in the city, erected not
for strength but merely in order
to dignify the family to whom it
belonged. By way of further distinction
to their owners, some of
these towers were so constructed
as to lean from the perpendicular.
Carisenda, like its taller neighbour
the Asinelli, still supplies a
striking feature to the near and
distant views of Bologna. What
is left of it hangs for more than
two yards off the plumb. In
the half-century after Dante’s
time it had, according to Benvenuto,
lost something of its
height. It would therefore as
the poet saw it seem to be
bending down even more than it
now does to any one standing
under it on the side it slopes to,
when a cloud is drifting over it
in the other direction.</p></div>

<h4>NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Ugolino della Gherardesca, Count of Donoratico, a wealthy
noble and a man fertile in political resource, was deeply engaged in
the affairs of Pisa at a critical period of her history. He was born
in the first half of the thirteenth century. By giving one of his
daughters in marriage to the head of the Visconti of Pisa—not to
be confounded with those of Milan—he came under the suspicion
of being Guelf in his sympathies; the general opinion of Pisa
being then, as it always had been, strongly Ghibeline. When
driven into exile, as he was along with the Visconti, he improved
the occasion by entering into close relations with the leading
Guelfs of Tuscany, and in 1278 a free return for him to Pisa was
made by them a condition of peace with that city. He commanded
one of the divisions of the Pisan fleet at the disastrous
battle of Meloria in 1284, when Genoa wrested from her rival the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
supremacy of the Western Mediterranean, and carried thousands of
Pisan citizens into a captivity which lasted many years. Isolated
from her Ghibeline allies, and for the time almost sunk in despair,
the city called him to the government with wellnigh dictatorial
powers; and by dint of crafty negotiations in detail with the
members of the league formed against Pisa, helped as was believed
by lavish bribery, he had the glory of saving the Commonwealth
from destruction though he could not wholly save it from loss.
This was in 1285. He soon came to be suspected of being in
a secret alliance with Florence and of being lukewarm in the
negotiations for the return of the prisoners in Genoa, all with a
view to depress the Ghibeline element in the city that he might
establish himself as an absolute tyrant with the greater ease. In
order still further to strengthen his position he entered into a
family compact with his Guelf grandson Nino (<i>Purg.</i> viii. 53),
now at the head of the Visconti. But without the support of the
people it was impossible for him to hold his ground against the
Ghibeline nobles, who resented the arrogance of his manners and
were embittered by the loss of their own share in the government;
and these contrived that month by month the charges of treachery
brought against him should increase in virulence. He had, by
deserting his post, caused the defeat at Meloria, it was said; and
had bribed the other Tuscan cities to favour him, by ceding to
them distant Pisan strongholds. His fate was sealed when,
having quarrelled with his grandson Nino, he sought alliance with
the Archbishop Roger who now led the Ghibeline opposition.
With Ugo’s connivance an onslaught was planned upon the Guelfs.
To preserve an appearance of impartiality he left the city for a
neighbouring villa. On returning to enjoy his riddance from a rival
he was invited to a conference, at which he resisted a proposal
that he should admit partners with him in the government. On
this the Archbishop’s party raised the cry of treachery; the bells
rang out for a street battle, in which he was worsted; and with his
sons he had to take refuge in the Palace of the People. There he
stood a short siege against the Ghibeline families and the angry
mob; and in the same palace he was kept prisoner for twenty
days. Then, with his sons and grandsons, he was carried in chains
to the tower of the Gualandi, which stood where seven ways met
in the heart of Pisa. This was in July 1288. The imprisonment
lasted for months, and seems to have been thus prolonged with the
view of extorting a heavy ransom. It was only in the following
March that the Archbishop ordered his victims to be starved to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
death; for, being a churchman, says one account, he would not
shed blood. Not even a confessor was allowed to Ugo and his
sons. After the door of the tower had been kept closed for
eight days it was opened, and the corpses, still fettered, were
huddled into a tomb in the Franciscan church.—The original
authorities are far from being agreed as to the details of Ugo’s
overthrow and death.—For the matter of this note I am chiefly
indebted to the careful epitome of the Pisan history of that time
by Philalethes in his note on this Canto (<i>Göttliche Comödie</i>).</p>

Ruggieri, of the Tuscan family
of the Ubaldini, to which the
Cardinal of <i>Inf.</i> x. 120 also
belonged. Towards the end of
his life he was summoned to
Rome to give an account of his
evil deeds, and on his refusal to
go was declared a rebel to the
Church. Ugolino was a traitor
to his country; Roger, having
entered into some sort of alliance
with Ugolino, was a traitor to
him. This has led some to
suppose that while Ugolino is
in Antenora he is so close to the
edge of it as to be able to reach
the head of Roger, who, as a
traitor to his friend, is fixed in
Ptolomæa. Against this view
is the fact that they are described
as being in the same hole
(xxxii. 125), and also that in
Ptolomæa the shades are set
with head thrown back, and
with only the face appearing
above the ice, while Ugo is
described as biting his foe at
where the skull joins the nape.
From line 91 it is clear that
Ptolomæa lay further on than
where Roger is. Like Ugo he
is therefore here as a traitor to
his country.</p></div>

be meant, where, as a Tuscan

sweetly pronounced than in any

noble who in 1275 slew his father-in-law
Michael Zanche (<i>Inf.</i> xxii.
88) while the victim sat at table
as his invited guest.—This mention
of Branca is of some value
in helping to ascertain when the
<i>Inferno</i> was finished. He was
in imprisonment and exile for
some time before and up to
1310. In 1311 he was one of
the citizens of Genoa heartiest in
welcoming the Emperor Henry
to their city. Impartial as Dante
was, we can scarcely think that
he would have loaded with
infamy one who had done what
he could to help the success of
Henry, on whom all Dante’s
hopes were long set, and by
their reception of whom on his
descent into Italy he continued
to judge his fellow-countrymen.
There is considerable reason to
believe that the <i>Inferno</i> was
published in 1309; this introduction
of Branca helps to prove
that at least it was published
before 1311. If this was so,
then Branca d’Oria lived long
enough to read or hear that for
thirty-five years his soul had
been in Hell.—It is significant
of the detestation in which
Dante held any breach of hospitality,
that it is as a treacherous
host and not as a treacherous
kinsman that Branca is punished—in
Ptolomæa and not in Caïna.
Cast as the poet was on the
hospitality of the world, any
disloyalty to its obligations
came home to him. For such
disloyalty he has invented one of
the most appalling of the fierce
retributions with the vision of
which he satisfied his craving
for vengeance upon prosperous
sin.—It may be that the idea
of this demon-possession of the
traitor is taken from the words,
‘and after the sop Satan
entered into Judas.’</p></div>

being so unworthy of
courtesy. See note on 117.
But another interpretation of
the words has been suggested
which saves Dante from the
charge of cruelty and mean
quibbling; namely, that he did
not clear the ice from the sinner’s
eyes because then he would
have been seen to be a living
man—one who could take back
to the world the awful news
that Alberigo’s body was the
dwelling-place of a devil.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_858_858" id="Footnote_858_858"></a><a href="#FNanchor_858_858"><span class="label">[858]</span></a> <i>Vexilla, etc.</i>: ‘<i>The banners
of the King of Hell advance</i>.’
The words are adapted from a
hymn of the Cross used in Holy
Week; and they prepare us to
find in Lucifer the opponent of
‘the Emperor who reigns on
high’ (<i>Inf.</i> i. 124). It is somewhat
odd that Dante should
have put a Christian hymn into
Virgil’s mouth.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_859_859" id="Footnote_859_859"></a><a href="#FNanchor_859_859"><span class="label">[859]</span></a> <i>Now was I where</i>: In the
fourth and inner division or
ring of the Ninth Circle. Here
are punished those guilty of
treachery to their lawful lords
or to their benefactors. From
Judas Iscariot, the arch-traitor,
it takes the name of Judecca.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_860_860" id="Footnote_860_860"></a><a href="#FNanchor_860_860"><span class="label">[860]</span></a> <i>Some stood, etc.</i>: It has
been sought to distinguish the
degrees of treachery of the
shades by means of the various
attitudes assigned to them. But
it is difficult to make more out
of it than that some are suffering
more than others. All of them
are the worst of traitors, hard-hearted
and cold-hearted, and
now they are quite frozen in the
ice, sealed up even from the
poor relief of intercourse with
their fellow-sinners.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_861_861" id="Footnote_861_861"></a><a href="#FNanchor_861_861"><span class="label">[861]</span></a> <i>The creature once, etc.</i>:
Lucifer, guilty of treachery
against the Highest, at <i>Purg.</i>
xii. 25 described as ‘created
noble beyond all other creatures.’
Virgil calls him Dis,
the name used by him for Pluto
in the <i>Æneid</i>, and the name
from which that of the City of
Unbelief is taken (<i>Inf.</i> viii. 68).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_862_862" id="Footnote_862_862"></a><a href="#FNanchor_862_862"><span class="label">[862]</span></a> <i>Judge then what bulk</i>: The
arm of Lucifer was as much
longer than the stature of one of
the giants as a giant was taller
than Dante. We have seen
(<i>Inf.</i> xxxi. 58) that the giants
were more than fifty feet in
height—nine times the stature
of a man. If a man’s arm be
taken as a third of his stature,
then Satan is twenty-seven times
as tall as a giant, that is, he is
fourteen hundred feet or so.
For a fourth of this, or nearly so—from
the middle of the breast
upwards—he stands out of the
ice, that is, some three hundred
and fifty feet. It seems almost
too great a height for Dante’s
purpose; and yet on the calculations
of some commentators his
stature is immensely greater—from
three to five thousand
feet.</p></div>

faces are represented the three
quarters of the world from which
the subjects of Lucifer are
drawn: vermilion or carnation
standing for Europe, yellow for
Asia, and black for Africa. Or
the faces may symbolise attributes
opposed to the Wisdom, Power,
and Love of the Trinity (<i>Inf.</i>
iii. 5). See also note on line 1.</p></div>

and flaps in dark and
noisome places. The simile
helps to bring more clearly
before us the dim light and half-seen
horrors of the Judecca.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_867_867" id="Footnote_867_867"></a><a href="#FNanchor_867_867"><span class="label">[867]</span></a> <i>Cassius</i>: It has been surmised
that Dante here confounds
the pale and lean Cassius who
was the friend of Brutus with
the L. Cassius described as corpulent
by Cicero in the Third
Catiline Oration. Brutus and
Cassius are set with Judas in
this, the deepest room of Hell,
because, as he was guilty of
high treason against his Divine
Master, so they were guilty of it
against Julius Cæsar, who, according
to Dante, was chosen
and ordained by God to found
the Roman Empire. As the
great rebel against the spiritual
authority Judas has allotted to
him the fiercer pain. To
understand the significance of
this harsh treatment of the great
Republicans it is necessary to
bear in mind that Dante’s
devotion to the idea of the
Empire was part of his religion,
and far surpassed in intensity all
we can now well imagine. In
the absence of a just and strong
Emperor the Divine government
of the world seemed to him
almost at a stand.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_868_868" id="Footnote_868_868"></a><a href="#FNanchor_868_868"><span class="label">[868]</span></a> <i>Night is rising</i>: It is
Saturday evening, and twenty-four
hours since they entered by
the gate of Inferno.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_869_869" id="Footnote_869_869"></a><a href="#FNanchor_869_869"><span class="label">[869]</span></a> <i>I thought to Hell, etc.</i>:
Virgil, holding on to Lucifer’s
hairy sides, descends the dark and
narrow space between him and
the ice as far as to his middle,
which marks the centre of the
earth. Here he swings himself
round so as to have his feet to
the centre as he emerges from
the pit to the southern hemisphere.
Dante now feels that
he is being carried up, and, able
to see nothing in the darkness,
deems they are climbing back
to the Inferno. Virgil’s difficulty
in turning himself round
and climbing up the legs of
Lucifer arises from his being
then at the ‘centre to which
all weights tend from every
part.’ Dante shared the erroneous
belief of the time, that
things grew heavier the nearer
they were to the centre of the
earth.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_870_870" id="Footnote_870_870"></a><a href="#FNanchor_870_870"><span class="label">[870]</span></a> <i>His upturned legs</i>: Lucifer’s
feet are as far above where
Virgil and Dante are as was his
head above the level of the
Judecca.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_871_871" id="Footnote_871_871"></a><a href="#FNanchor_871_871"><span class="label">[871]</span></a> <i>What point, etc.</i>: The centre
of the earth. Dante here feigns
to have been himself confused—a
fiction which helps to fasten
attention on the wonderful fact
that if we could make our way
through the earth we should require
at the centre to reverse our
posture. This was more of a
wonder in Dante’s time than
now.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_872_872" id="Footnote_872_872"></a><a href="#FNanchor_872_872"><span class="label">[872]</span></a> <i>Mid tierce</i>: The canonical
day was divided into four parts,
of which Tierce was the first and
began at sunrise. It is now
about half-past seven in the
morning. The night was beginning
when they took their departure
from the Judecca: the day
is now as far advanced in the
southern hemisphere as they
have spent time on the passage.
The journey before them
is long indeed, for they have to
ascend to the surface of the earth.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_873_873" id="Footnote_873_873"></a><a href="#FNanchor_873_873"><span class="label">[873]</span></a> <i>To morn from night</i>:
Dante’s knowledge of the time
of day is wholly derived from
what Virgil tells him. Since
he began his descent into the
Inferno he has not seen the sun.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_874_874" id="Footnote_874_874"></a><a href="#FNanchor_874_874"><span class="label">[874]</span></a> <i>’Neath whose summit</i>: Jerusalem
is in the centre of
the northern hemisphere—an
opinion founded perhaps on
<i>Ezekiel</i> v. 5: ‘Jerusalem I
have set in the midst of the
nations and countries round
about her.’ In the <i>Convito</i>, iii.
5, we find Dante’s belief regarding
the distribution of land
and sea clearly given: ‘For
those I write for it is enough to
know that the Earth is fixed and
does not move, and that, with
the ocean, it is the centre of the
heavens. The heavens, as we
see, are for ever revolving around
it as a centre; and in these revolutions
they must of necessity
have two fixed poles.... Of these
one is visible to almost all the
dry land of the Earth; and that
is our north pole [star]. The
other, that is, the south, is out of
sight of almost all the dry land.’</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_875_875" id="Footnote_875_875"></a><a href="#FNanchor_875_875"><span class="label">[875]</span></a> <i>The Man</i>: The name of
Christ is not mentioned in the
<i>Inferno</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_876_876" id="Footnote_876_876"></a><a href="#FNanchor_876_876"><span class="label">[876]</span></a> <i>Land, as of yore, etc.</i>: On
the fall of Lucifer from the
southern sky all the dry land of
that hemisphere fled before him
under the ocean and took refuge
in the other; that is, as much land
emerged in the northern hemisphere
as sank in the southern.
But the ground in the direct line
of his descent to the centre of
the earth heaped itself up into the
Mount of Purgatory—the only
dry land left in the southern
hemisphere. The Inferno was
then also hollowed out; and, as
Mount Calvary is exactly antipodal
to Purgatory, we may
understand that on the fall of
the first rebels the Mount of
Reconciliation for the human
race, which is also that of Purification,
rose out of the very
realms of darkness and sin.—But,
as Todeschini points out,
the question here arises of
whether the Inferno was not
created before the earth. At
<i>Parad</i>. vii. 124, the earth, with
the air and fire and water, is
described as ‘corruptible and
lasting short while;’ but the
Inferno is to endure for aye, and
was made before all that is not
eternal (<i>Inf.</i> iii. 8).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_877_877" id="Footnote_877_877"></a><a href="#FNanchor_877_877"><span class="label">[877]</span></a> <i>Belzebub</i>: Called in the
Gospel the prince of the devils.
It may be worth mentioning
here that Dante sees in Purgatory
(<i>Purg.</i> viii. 99) a serpent
which he says may be that which
tempted Eve. The identification
of the great tempter with
Satan is a Miltonic, or at any
rate a comparatively modern
idea.</p></div>

to be the same as Lethe, one of
the rivers of the Earthly Paradise.
It certainly descends from
the Mount of Purgatory.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_880_880" id="Footnote_880_880"></a><a href="#FNanchor_880_880"><span class="label">[880]</span></a> <i>The stars</i>: Each of the
three divisions of the Comedy
closes with ‘the stars.’ These,
as appears from <i>Purg.</i> i. are the
stars of dawn. It was after sunrise
when they began their
ascent to the surface of the earth,
and so nearly twenty-four hours
have been spent on the journey—the
time it took them to
descend through Inferno. It
is now the morning of Easter
Sunday—that is, of the true
anniversary of the Resurrection
although not of the day observed
that year by the Church. See
<i>Inf.</i> xxi. 112.</p></div>

paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
