            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <img src="me.jpg" alt="Me">
            <p>I am a fourth-year computing science student and the University of Alberta. My interests lie
            in creating useful products which have a meaningful impact. I enjoy finding solutions to unique technical
            problems and all forms of work which require creativity. Outside of programming, I enjoy brewing beer and
            wine in eternal pursuit of artisanal quality.</p>

        <div class="history" id="history">
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>I worked on a year-long internship for LegacyX Software as technical support on a small team of 9 people.
                This role
            exposed me to direct client interaction and management as well as how ot participate in a scrum team. I
            supported and regularly built/deployed a C# program on client servers. This was a small enough company that
            I got exposure to a wide variety of roles and tasks, ranging from mundane ad-hoc sql database modification
            per support requests to bug fixes and feature addition. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="whatioffer" id = whatioffer>
            <h2>What I offer</h2>
            <p>I bring a fair amount of experience in how to view the differences between a non-technical client's
            requests and how to best implement their vision such that requirements are met, while remaining open
            to probable subsequent changes. I am very interested in the "big picture" of how my software will affect a
            client's business, subsequent support for that product and subsequent feature additions. I hate doing work
            twice for any reason! This is a great source of strength for how I approach projects-- rather than
                head-down technical development, I hope to understand the larger picture and make the right decisions
            the first time.</p>
